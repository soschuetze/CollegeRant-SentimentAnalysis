0,I hate people that take advantage of me,5,"There's this girl I've been friends with since the first week of college. She makes me sit beside her during tests so she can cheat off of me. She also made me do her project because she ""doesn't know what to do"". When we had a group project to do together she made me do all the work. And got the same grades for it as I did.

Now, I dont mind helping people out at all. But what annoys me about this chick is that she ignores me otherwise. Doesn't reply to my texts. Doesn't help me out with shit. If I was helping someone out the bare minimum I'd expect from them would be to at least not ignore me.

Anyway, yesterday I lost it when she asked me to give her answers for another test. I told her that I was sick of her taking advantage of me and that she needed to do stuff herself. I admit I was a bit loud and harsh in my tone, because some people sitting behind us in class overheard me and laughed out loud. My friend apologized and told me to stop embarassing her in front of them. She hasn't spoken to me since.

The thing about her is that she's quiet and shy, doesnt really talk to people. So I can't call her a stereotypical mean girl. Nonetheless I don't like how she took advantage of me and I don't regret telling her off.

1,"Scattered unprepared instructor, Everyone using chatGpt FML",2,"First week of the quarter and seriously just a shit show. It seems like a majority of people are just literally copying and pasting from chat gpt. Don’t get me wrong, AI is nice to do grammar checks or to help you brainstorm or put a sentence together ect. But I mean people are literally copying and pasting the entire text word for word and you can tell. 

As an adult I’m here because I want to learn and get a career in something I’m passionate about. To have people surrounding you that are doing the bare minimum and taking shortcuts fucking sucks. It honestly scares me for the future. People aren’t using their own brains and these people are going to be our next doctors leaders ect. I just can’t. 

Then the instructor had weeks to prepare for the new quarter and everything is just a shit show.

2,Why do people look down on the trades?,2,"Everyone loves to look down on trades because they’re hot & dirty until they need one. My brother is an airplane mechanic and i have nothing but respect. He also gets paid very handsomely & loves what he does & doesn’t have to sit in a boring office job all day like most of us will.

Trades also have no student loan debt.

Yeah sure, maybe trade schools don’t have sports or frats or diversity, but you cant just be thinking about partying and having fun all the time. Especially if there’s debt involved. Its just stupid.

I’m a community college student getting a 2 year IT degree with no debt & i have no regrets about not being in a frat or living in a dorm. Its just stupid and a waste of money. Those same people end up in office jobs they hate while trade workers have more fulfilling careers. 

Fyi: being a douchey frat guy or sorority girl & getting drunk every weekend at college isn’t gonna help with your career.",Character_Log_2657
3,College is the first time I really learned how important physical looks are,0,"So many people say everyone is beautiful or that looks don’t matter, but that couldn’t be further from the truth. In college, I automatically get dismissed from friend groups because of my looks. People tell me I am ugly and to avoid me behind my back. While waiting in line for sports games, people come around to take pictures of students, and I get explicitly told to leave the photo shot along with under students who aren’t conventionally attractive. Looks matter, and it is pretty important for most people",Big-Damage5731
4,I failed my pre-calc class even though I fully grasp the topic and do the work as much as I can.,37,"I absolutely hate aleks, I have topics to do everyday and it really messed me up. On top of ""having to devote 2 hours everyday and treat it like a gym membership"" as my professor says, I have a job that takes 3 hours out of my day just to get to because I don't have a car (a 4 hour shift becomes a 6hr commitment), I workout about 1-2hr everyday and will absolutely not sacrifice that time. By the time I get home it's 10pm and I have to do homework for ALL my classes and apparently need to find time to devote those two hours to aleks, and then wake up at 8am to repeat the day. AND pre-calc ended up just being algebra review which I already know VERY WELL, now I have to retake it, and it costs me money and destroys my chances at transferring out of my community college.

5,"Recently, I told my group members what work needed to be done. They said they can do that. Then, they didn't do it. Other than just doing all their work, what should I do in future group projects with problems like this?",13,"Hi all. I go to a low-ranked college. I think that will be a very important detail.

From my experience, people in group projects constantly listen to me when I say what work needs to be done. But people in other group projects do not listen to me. 

Once, my prof had a group project where the group had to write paper and include 2 unique graphics. As the leader, I split the work up. My prof and I mentioned many times that the graphics need to be unique. I did the first unique graphic and Teammate 3 agreed to do the second unique graphic. Imagine my surprise when he said he finished all his work, but it is definitely not unique. It is just copied and pasted from the web?! I just did the 2nd unique graphic. 

Recently, I had a group project with another person. I split the work 50%-50%. I did all the hard technical work. I gave him the easy non-technical work. It is very simple, but just takes some time. It is much easier than the complicated and time-consuming technical work I did. I literally said what needs to be added and asked if he can do that. He literally says yes. A few days later, he sends his work and says he will add some more. First of all, it is like 50% done instead of being 100% . It is kind of hard to explain, but the major problem is that 50% of that work is like the same as my work instead of being different and related. That meant that it is redundant and useless. He didn't listen to what I literally said. I ended up just going his part as well. The final project was A, but around and over 90% my work, but likely even more considering I did all the hard technical work. 

This strange thing also happened for another group project. I literally told me 3 Teammates what work needs to be done. They all agreed they can do that before next week. Imagine my surprise when it is 1 week later and no one did anything. Like 0 work. Teammate 1 explained that she will make sure to do it next week because she was focusing on another class. Teammate 1 did thankfully finish like 50% of their part. But Teammate 2 did literally 0%. Only Teammate 3 did around 100% of their part. It was up to me again to spend my time doing everyone's missing work. 

Was I doing something wrong? I specifically said what needs to be done and literally asked these group members. They literally said they can do it.  I think the fundamental problem is that I go to a low-ranked college. I am a smart student that has an unhealthy obsession with getting A's on everything. From my experience, so many students here just don't give a fuck. I think they realize that I will do all the work. This has been the story of my life during middle school and high school group projects in my low ranked school district. This is pretty much the only reason I wish I went to a top college. I think I would better fit in there and find people with similar determination to learn and get the best grades. 

Other than doing all their work, is the only solution for me to just report it to the prof or doing student evals? ",Terrible_Exchange653
6,(Off-campus housing) Housing Agency scheduled a tour at my place for 9 AM,2,"I’m currently leasing a house with a couple of other college students. The housing agency we’re leasing through has been fine for the most part, but I can’t say I’m too happy about people poking around our spaces. Yes, it’s in the lease I signed. Yes they give a 24-hour heads up (more like 22 hours since we were texted at 10:46 yesterday, but I digress). And yes, I’m usually not home when they’re touring for it to matter too much (except for the one time they scheduled like three tours in the same weekend because it was parent’s weekend). But it’s still a pain in the ass to have to cater these tours and having to be self-conscious about what ought to be my private space, especially this early on in the day.

I’ve got classes at 10, so this is usually around the time I’m still in bed or hopping in the shower before heading out to class. It’s not the biggest deal in the world to wake up early and having to have a somewhat tidy room mind you. I’m groggy and a little cranky, but whatever. The kicker is that it’s not even for the next school year. It’s for two years in advance ffs. Next year’s already leased out. Who would be scheduling a tour this far in advance, at this time in the morning, to check out this old shitty house that’s suuuper not up-to-code?! I’ve got more important things to care about than tidying up for freshmen house-shopping, and with me being somewhere else next semester, I’ve half-a-mind to not really give a shit anyway. But I’d rather not have the landlord ticked off at us for this last month, just in case they get picky with the security deposit. Still, that doesn‘t change how inconvenient and annoying these visits are though.  You’d think with next year’s lease being already signed, we wouldn’t have had to deal with this at this point…

Just in general, I’ve been frustrated with college housing lately. Housing and real estate has been a major problem for my college town ever since they over-enrolled students after COVID. But I’m sure the realtors around here are happy taking advantage of that. The locals are starting to get priced out, the campus and classes are getting crowded, and there’s fewer apartment complexes than there ought to be to support this population density, so the market is competitive.

As for how it’s specifically impacted me, I’m graduating in December you see, so most of my buddies, who would potentially be roommates, are graduating before me next month. And I would need accommodations for only one semester. So if I hadn’t miraculously found a sub-lease for the Fall, I would’ve had to go back to the over-priced dorms because housing places around here are super stingy about having anything signed for less than a year. They know they have the student market wrapped around their finger.

I’m just so done with this. And with how crazy the housing market is everywhere, it’s hard to even be excited for the possibility of saving up for a house of my own after graduation.

TL;DR: Realtors are giving a tour in my place at 9 AM, which is when I’d normally be in-bed or in the shower, for a group that would be signing two years in advance. Really, I’m just ranting about the housing situation in my college town in general. Over-priced (off and on-campus), overly competitive, and landlords taking advantage of the student market to the student’s detriment as well as the locals’.",LoneWolf1ngIt
7,College feels like Navy SEAL training,0,"I don’t understand how other people find college to be easy. I go to UCLA, and my four years feel like special warfare training in the military. Even if you are working as fast and efficiently as possible, classes stack even more work on. You have to pull all nighters constantly even when you are studying at max efficiency. College is also the first time where you deal with rejection and selection, and it is mindblowing how a random club got a hobby can be incredibly hard to join. I never made it into a single club during my time in college. I never made any friends or been to parties because I need 80 hours of studying just to get Cs. I don’t know how anyone thrives in college unless they went to some diploma mill",Big-Damage5731
8,I think I've screwed myself,10,"I'm in the last month of college and whilst other assignments I kept on top of I stupidly decided to do a dissertation for my degree. I'm in my last year (4th year) haven't really enjoyed my college experience due to my severe anxiety and depression but did what I could to push myself through it all.

Anyway about the dissertation I only recently agreed upon my topic because I'm stupid and a huge procrastionator and thus have nothing really done for it bar a little research. It's 8000 words and due May 8th. I truly hate myself for putting myself in this mess and on top of that I have two other assignments due at that time as well, both essays are 3500 words.

My mental health has been declining everyday and my supervisor kinda thinks I'm a lost cause (I don't blame her with how I've been with this dissertation). I regret doing it when I should have just picked modules but stupid me was like it'll give me prep for my masters thesis.

I kinda just want to give up and crawl in a hole and die or something like that. Anyone know how to just snap out of severe depression and panic attacks daily and just get your ass in gear? I just don't know what to do, I've been barely sleeping, eating poorly and just in a state of constant stress and suicidal thoughts. The counsellors on campus are always busy so can never get in with them. I genuinely don't know what to do anymore.

10,Acquaintance is being an ass,14,"How do I begin?

On October of last year, I (senior, electrical & computer engineering) was approached by a junior in the same program about an internship that I got over the summer. He wanted people he could speak to to put his name forward early for the opportunity. 

I didn't think much of it. I gave him names and he gladly went on his way. Didn't think much of it. Anyone would have wanted the internship, especially since it was one that fit both our future goals (power engineering).

During thanksgiving break, I was put in a situation where I stayed with the junior at another person's house. Again, nothing much. I saw him as an acquaintance but I guess he took his experience talking to me about the internship to talk about other opportunities I had.

During the Thanksgiving break, he asked me for opportunities in a research fellowship I did back in my Sophomore year. I was...getting quite annoyed for some reason, but I let it go. I told him about the opportunity and he made the approach to get the fellowship. He was successful.

I didn't hear much from him after that. Honestly he didn't bother talking to me in class or outside of it for the matter. I think that irked me because I felt more like he was using me. It was then that I started seeing this junior as a leech because he made no effort to hide the fact that he only saw me as a connection he could use.

Fast forward to a few months into 2024. Turns out the internship I had wasn't available this year and he was not happy about it. He bothered me once again to ask if there was anyone else he could talk to to get the internship but unfortunately I had none. He walked away and didn't speak to me afterwards.

Fast forward a month later, he finds out that for my senior project I have been using software related to power engineering and has been bothering me nonstop to show him my work and to teach him. He has even spoken with my senior project advisor to talk to me to teach him. At this point I have begun ghosting him and ignoring him, because all I can think now is how much of a leech he is for wanting all the opportunities I fought to get, and only that.

I am sick of this kid, and I am tired of him constantly bothering me about my opportunities. For a friend, I would gladly do what I can to help them land success, but this kid just found me and decided that he was gonna suck every single bit of opportunity I had and then just leave me alone. He reminds me of a classmate that doesn't listen in the classroom and asks me to help him out on the homework. You can't rely on me forever and I don't want him to bother me anymore.

The only reason why I tolerate him is because I'll be graduating in less than a month and I don't want to cause problem. But jeez, this kid just does not know how to leave people alone. I wish I could just walk up to him, tell him no, flip him off, and be on my merry way. That is something I have been dreaming to do for a long time now. 

tl;dr: annoying underclassman clearly just wants to use me for opportunities in power engineering without trying to work for them himself or be nice about it

11,Insomnia driving me insane...,1,"I got sick for a little bit last Thursday-Saturday so I took those days off no biggie right? Most of my work was due either next Tuesday or Thursday. I didn't ask for an extension for the work on Tuesday as usually those assignments only take 1-2 days to do each with a little bit of overlap and by chance, the Professor decided to move them to Thursday anyway. Cool.

From Sunday to Thursday, I had time to do the homework and some stuff for a paper which was already a work in progress. Well, I couldn't sleep at all Saturday, Sunday, and Monday night. I got maybe a total of 3 hours of actual sleep and for the rest of the night, I kept waking up every 30-40 minutes? This has never happened to me like this before, or at least for so many days in a row... I had to skip class because I didn't even realize I was nodding off until it had already happened. I couldn't even walk in a straight line.

I got sleep finally on Tuesday night but that leaves me with only today... Tomorrow I have a 10-15 minute presentation, a 1000-word weekly reading reflection, a complete modeling section for my paper, and a weekly coding assignment due.

What's driving me insane was that I really did try to do work Sunday-Tuesday, and I couldn't get myself to focus at all. I tried to cut down on caffeine in the evenings, and avoided taking any naps over an hour during the day and nothing worked.

I even tried to schedule a job interview for this Friday but only Thursday was available.. which is tomorrow!!!

Most of these classes don't accept extensions unless there's a doctor's note... I'll just take the L but I really did try...

TL;DR - Couldn't sleep for three days, and now have too much work due and a job interview all on the same day.",hbuhthisisausername
12,Looking for advice on a package that was SIGNED FOR by a confirmed employee at my university's mail room that was not actually delivered to me/scanned into their system,5,"Hey all - hopefully this is a question I can ask here because I'm in a tough situation right now and need some advice from people who maybe have gone through something similar with mail delivery at their university.

Today at 11:30 AM, I had a USPS Priority Express package delivered to my mail room, one that was sent out to me from the East Coast on Monday morning. As many of you all may relate to, I am currently in a living situation where packages aren't delivered directly to my doorstep, but instead to a mail room that resides inside of a UPS Store near my dorm. When packages are delivered to this location, they usually are put in a locker and scanned into their system within a few hours, prompting an email and a code telling the recipient that they have a package available for pickup.

Here is where things get weird. I checked my tracking at around noon and noticed that the package had been delivered to my UPS mail room at 11:35 on the dot; the package was even signed for by someone who was later confirmed to be an actual mail room employee. After about 5 hours with no email or locker pickup notification, I headed to the UPS store to inquire about my package. After providing the tracking number, they said that my package was supposedly signed for by a real worker, but had no record of existing in their system or being scanned into a locker. When I asked if there was a chance it would be scanned in tomorrow, they told me that all the packages they had received that day had been dealt with accordingly already.

I then ran to my local post office to explain the situation with them. They showed me the pinpoint address to which my package was delivered (it was correct), and they also showed me a scan of the physical signature they received upon delivery.

Frankly, I'm kind of dumbfounded by this situation, and unsure what to do. This package is incredibly important, hence it being sent via Priority Express, and I need input as to the most likely scenario here. Was my package perhaps accidentally left on the USPS truck and the whole shipment was signed for by the mail room employee? Was my package misplaced and currently is sitting somewhere in the mail room? Was it stolen? Please help me understand this, and perhaps advise some next steps I can take to find my package. Thank you so much.",wesagod
13,Literally how do people get girlfriends in college without joining a frat?,128,"Everyone's got different schedules so i rarely even meet the same women for very long, if at all, most of my hobbies are male-oriented and/or introverted/intellectual solo activities, and id very quickly be known as the creep if I just tried asking out random girls around campus day-game style.

14,I thought I “liked” coding; I’m so done,83,"I knew from an early age I wanted to be a game designer (keyword). I wanted to build games, characters, and tells fantastical stories that would change the way people think. I thought the best way to do this would be through learning how to code as coding so the backbone of a game right? So I majored in Computer Science focusing on the game development aspect. 


Well, I’ve been doing this crap for almost 3 years now and I barely know anything. Coding is not fun, I dread doing the coding aspect of game dev because it just doesn’t make sense. You’d think this would be fun, but I don’t even know where to begin. I’ve constantly used Youtube tutorials and help from others to get by these last 3 years. I wish it would be as easy as business or something where the work is more self explanatory so I could focus on creating, but I actually have to learn how to use the tools before I can even touch the canvas. 


Idk it’s just so demotivating and I’ve lost almost all the passion I had before I started. I still want to do this, but this coding stuff is like my kryptonite. I wanted to be a designer like story telling, levels, characters, etc… and I believed a traditional coding degree would be that stepping stone. But I can’t keep relying on YouTube tutorials and others forever. I’m not sure what to do anymore at this point. ",Taakane
15,I regret college and hate the 'pay to win' education system,18,"fr just wanted to try and further my education, I'm an environmental technician in Canada not that it matters.   
I have passion beyond most of my classmates and know my stuff about biology but because a piece of paper means everything it doesn't matter.  
because even if I wanted to become a biologist and write papers the disgusting roughly 13k (over 20k with housing and crap) only gets the ability to then apply for a bachelor course or similar with money I don't have cause the Canadian economy is vile, I paid all my college and housing out of pocket through savings I had since high school and now I am closer to the edge than ever.  


Basically what I'm trying to say is that education is only for the rich.  


For example yesterday my professor brought up a trip the biology students plan to grenada where you can get a coral recovery degree and dive and do whatever. But this year they had to cancel due to 'lack of interest' when that's fucking a lie, I literally am tear brought that I'm some low class loser because I wanted to go so bad its my literal dream and to than be told I just need to 'get a job and work hard' I grinded my teeth. Because me and my husband are on the fast track to becoming homeless because we have hardly any income despite him working and me studying (I try to do art on the side) and to constantly be spat in the face by college and just education system in general is- annoying to say the least.  


Not to add I've had horrible mental health following my mothers death right when I got approved for the program to my cousin dying and now my grandparents may not survive the year. I have been clear and open to my professors and feels like no one cares. I thought college was going to be great.. I just wanted to make friends while learning about the things I love but unless you come with a silver spoon or a lucky draw than its futile. Because I have been nothing but pushed around my classmates and feel unwanted.  


Thanks for coming to my ted talk, I'm open to talk and answer questions. :''')  


**TL;DR**

biology student hates the education system and despite hoping for the ideal college experience it's been a living nightmare, with a pinch of personal misfortune.

20,seeking out a second opinion on a close friendship ,4,"hey guys, i am making this post to share the dynamics of a specific friendship of mine and to ask for an outside opinion. i plan on talking abt this w my therapist and eventually the friend once i have a better grasp on how i feel. 

i’m an 18 year old freshman who’s in a living learning community through my school. all of the members of this living learning community live in the same dorm building, typically have a roommate who’s also in the program, and we all attend weekly meetings together > because of this, everyone in the program very quickly became friends with each other. 

i’m friends with everyone in the program, but there is one person who i built the strongest connection with and we consider each other to be each other’s “college best friend.”

she truly means so much to me and i have never felt so close to someone before in the way i have with her; in many ways, she feels similarly and she considers me to the biggest part of her support system here at school. 

during our first semester, we had a balanced friendship. we would hangout frequently while also having a strong emotional connection where we could easy have any heart to heart conversation you could imagine. 

however, we both had stressors hit during the transition from first semester to second semester. as a result, we began to meet up more just for the heart to heart talks/ emotional support, rather than to have light and flowy positive interactions like we used to. 

i’m starting to feel insecure in this friendship bc i want to maintain the balance we once had, yet she only hangs out with other people when she wants light interactions and we only end up meeting if she needs a heart to heart. this makes me feel as if she’s not happy around me and rather be w other people significantly more? it makes me feel almost jealous. 

we’ve talked about this before at least a few times and each time she says she’s not truly fully happy or problem free around all these other friends she’s hanging out with, she just feels less vulnerable with them and more vulnerable with me which is why i see more of the sad stuff.

but i’m not sure this heart to heart connection feels as good anymore when i lack the balance that built this level of comfort in the first place. our friendship has been like this all semester; at times her coming to me to vent every night and others is not interacting for days until we need to have a heart to heart talk, but it’s never anything more than that?

i think i need to talk to her again, but i want to ask: what would you do in this situation? what things could be done to resolve it or should i accept it for the fact it has changed and focus on other friendships with more balance ",Sufficient-War-8748
21,It's always something,8,"Currently trying to get through a series of group projects that my professor expects copies of tomorrow, but the kicker is that prof did not give the class any instructions on these projects until this afternoon, and each thing requires a lot research, thought, as well as graphic design know how (this course is not connected in graphic design in any way but prof expected us to shell out hundreds of dollars on photoshop software to make infographics). And we were given these instructions on our first day back from a long weekend; a long weekend that if we were given these instructions before we could have gotten everything done on our own pace.

I wish that I could say that this was the first time this prof has sprung stuff on us like this, but just last week we were told on Monday that we would be surprise presenting our semester projects to an alumni that following Wednesday, with no notice that we should have anything presentable at that point, and that our presentations should be 3-15 minutes long! Naturally every group is scrambling to get presentations prepared and practice talking points. Wednesday rolls around and then we all get an email 3 hours before class with all the specific information and layout that she expects to see, and that each group will only have 5 minutes to present, woohooo. So not only did that lead to even more frantic revisions, but the professor, who constantly asks if we are proud of our work, gave us little ability to make a good presentation for the alum, which really rubbed us the wrong way. Thankfully he was cool and super nice, but prof had the gall to joke about their lack of notice.

I just don't understand what kind of professor thinks putting students under this much stress and workload is productive for teaching. This class isn't a hard science or anything, it just seems that prof wants to put every student at as much of a disadvantage as possible.

24,feel so annoying bc i loudly sobbed in my dorm,268,"so my roommates were already best friends before i got here, and for the most part we were good! like hellos and goodbyes, cordial, we didn’t really mean personality wise/no similar interests but it was good! i got invited to watch a movie w them but both times i had deadlines, but that’s alright.

i’m very good at being tidy and stuff but tbh i atick to my room cuz that’s just what i’ve always done? like weird family life and i just always am in my room most the time. ANYWAYS i found out some debestating news last week and had like 2 (og typed 3 but it’s 2 looking back). nights where i was crying really loudly for like 1-2hrs at a time. like i feel so bad but i was also SUPER sick so i didn’t even care how loud i was crying. i’m embarassed thinking ab it now kinda. cuz i know i was pretty loud but i wasn’t really thinking about anything other than the news/being sick


anyways now everybody’s kinda weird around me😭😭 yall i feel so weird and bad!! like no more hi’s and goodbyes, the one i hung out w in her room for like an hour once doing a craft (she’s in a sorority and i like painting so i offered to help her paint her cooler) is the coldest of all, just straight up putting my laundry on the couch bc i was late w the dryer for like 20 mins when i was in the shower but before it was always a text or something, that’s what i did for them too.

like my presence is not acknowledged anymore and i get like the smile but it feels like a ‘oh gee hey’ smile


and i feel so weird and creepy now! but genuinely i was going through such a bad fucking time a part of me is like ‘literally who cares it’s fine u won’t see them in 2 months’ but i just feel rlly rejected? and i’m hyper aware of how i treat ppl too and can read social cues well, if i was being weird or anything i’d know! but idk.



i just feel stupid and awkward now😭 also i am the only POC/immigrant here but i highly doubt that’s relevant. but maybe it’s a cultural thing?? is that even a possibility cuz i’ve been raised in ameirca most my life so 



also to be clear i’m not expecting anything from them, i’m 1000% ok that it was never mentioned and i was never asked how i am or anything like that. i just didn’t think it would change anything? like when one of them was rlly upset and the other two were having a girls night to comfort her i didn’t say anything and was perfectly ok, didn’t bother them",Zarabbyy
25,Group projects are the WORST,11,"TLDR: group project is an absolute disaster and I just need to go on a long-winded rant about it, feel free to disregard.

I just really hate that I can spend hours and hours of my time working and just get completely screwed over by someone slacking off.

So I'm in an Intro to Engineering Design course and it's entirely centered around a group project made up of 6 milestones and despite my best efforts I'm probably walking away with a goddamn C because people keep screwing me over and I'm absolutely livid about it. Because of COURSE I let my group members talk me into water filtration so there are hundreds of things that can go wrong...I just wanted to build a spinny little electronic thread carousel.

Milestones 1 and 2 went okay but MS3 is where shit hit the fan and it's just been downhill ever since. So they decided to make MS3 due once we get back from break which would've been great! extra time to work on it without worrying about lectures! EXCEPT for the fact that three of my group members didn't bother responding to anything till Sunday night (assignment was a 30ish page paper due Wednesday). Then Monday I look at what they have and good lord. It was a disaster. Some sections were literally just two sentences completely irrelevant to the rubric and template so I had to go in and add stuff because holy shit I did not want to put my name on that dumpster fire. Then Wednesday night we're grinding this stupid thing out and all of a sudden all but one leave to study for exams, but apparently they had the time to text us reminders and ask us to finish their sections.

And then we had our MS4 presentation today and it was a hot mess. The whole point of MS4 was showing our design could be functional but everything just fell apart completely. So my partner has been super busy with the play and I'm like fine. Just do the writeups and go to the shop and work when you can we don't need to meet. So I spend hours in the shop skipping meals and staying up till 4-5 am doing other homework so I can maximize shop time and then he shows up on Friday with his one contribution at that point...a 3D printed cap. It took him a full damn week and the time I took to build a 3 foot tall support frame...to model a tiny cap to fit on a one gallon jug. And then we have to caulk everything so that takes an entire day so it's fucking SUNDAY (presentation is Tuesday) and we are just testing for the first goddamn time. We get one or two successful tests but I take it home to run more to check things and do our presentation and the pump just...stops working. Great. Fantastic. So it's 4am I've been working on this damn project all day by myself because of course he has rehearsal and I'm sopping wet because the fucking thing won't stop overflowing and then he just says ""let's meet before class to try fixing this"" so we meet at 8am and then he starts going on about how he's sorry he couldn't be more help and him being here is him showing he's committed because he normally doesn't get up this early and at this point i am about to lose it. Oh I'm sorry did you think I want to be here at 8 in the fuckin morning? I'm tired sore frustrated and angry this is the LAST place I want to be. Like he's done barely anything other than the tiny little cap outside of class time and one team meeting we had and he's here talking about how committed he is because he showed up at 8am like sir I am right fucking here I've spent the last six days working on this project well over three hours a day shut up about your commitment

And of course apparently the practice of READING THE FUCKING RUBRIC is lost on most of my group so I always have to explain what's needed even though it's right there. I had to explain what a fucking iteration was to them and point it out on the slides because yes you WERE supposed to look at more than one design option?

And worst of all the damn thing leaked all over my laptop (was using it as a timer for video recording) so now the keyboard's all fucked up. Thank god I got it through my school so it's covered under warranty but that's just one more thing I did not have time or energy to deal with

All in all this is going to be one WILD peer review at the end of the semester.",iron-niffler
26,How do I get through this situation?,20,"Hey y’all. I need some help figuring out this blunder I got myself in. 

Long story short. I signed up for an extra curricular 2 unit class during my last semester in college(in the fall). It was a guitar class I thought it’d be a cute way to enrich the day. 

I didn’t know this class wouldn’t be covered by financial aid. By the third week of class when I noticed a charge on my account - i immediately reached out to financial aid to figure out the charge and reached out to the registrar to remove the class from my account and I stopped attending. 

The registrar said - I was too late and that I should’ve known the policy. We continued going back and forth - now getting my advisor involved, student services involved, my academic school involved, the cultural center involved, and even the dean involved. 

They all didn’t know what to do and pretty much said the registrar has the final say. 

It’s a 4,000 mistake that’s hindering me from graduating this May. I financially support myself and every bank, loan agency , etc. I’ve gone too won’t give 4000 to a student living pay check to paycheck with mediocre credit. I’m maxed out on federal loans - and don’t have anyone else to financially lean on. I don’t know what to do at this point. I was really banking on the alumni association to throw me a bone - but I just got off the phone with them and they said, we can’t pay for a class you didn’t take. 😭

I’m legit lost - I don’t know how I got myself into this situation ",CharlesBurray
27,Gen eds suck,0,"I'll never understand why people defend gen eds. An engineering major should not be taking philosophy courses. The argument is that ""it makes you well rounded"", I strongly disagree. Unused knowledge is forgotten knowledge, there's a reason someone who got an A+ in calc 3 can't solve a pre-calc level problem 5 years later. Not to mention the vast majority of them are rehashes of high school courses anyways, with the major difference being they cost the same as someone's rent. It's hard to justify spending so much time and money for an ""education"" that will not be utilized in most people's life outside of college. 

Edit: 

Based on what I’ve read, I want to add that gen eds are not common outside of the United States. So claiming they are necessary to develop a particular set of skills, like “critical thinking or communication” is ignorant at worst and bold at best. ",PrivateTurt

I’m ADHD as well which adds a whole other level of stress to it.

However, the online quizzes are super difficult and advanced, way beyond what we are doing for our assignments. Lot of the stuff is super niche. I even tried to look up this info, and it's pretty hard to come by. I don't think the professor creates these quizzes, I think some third party does and they just wanted to torture students.

35,Having a bad memory sucks,650,"I'm transferring to a different school to finish my degree. A while back my new advisor told me that certain credits will transfer as required credits for my degree. Good.

So, today I was required to meet with my advisor. This time it's with someone else. No heads up btw.

This new advisor teaches classes in my degree program, and he's asking me a bunch of vague questions about my past classes. Like ""what did you learn in your prior classes?"" I answer several different things, and he goes ""anything else?"" And I'm like uh is there something you are looking for in particular? ""Yes. I'm waiting for you to say it."" He refuses to give me a hint, or let me take a proficiency exam. Gotta remember everything on the spot. 

I'm just like I'm sorry I have a bad memory and he's like ""if you can't prove the prior courses proficiency to me I won't allow your credits to transfer in as the required ones. They will be extracurricular ones instead."" I offer to show him past projects, or answer any questions, but he says no. 

So, some of my required credits probably won't transfer and I'll have to retake equivalent classes that I already got A's in. Oh and, since they are prerequisite classes I can't take the upper level classes. This would add another year of school. Ugh.",SunlessDahlia

37,Group members not taking hints.,11,"All my oblivious group members do is yap and complain.

I'm so annoyed with my sociology group.

A little NSFW background..
~
I am in a group for a sociology class and the group chat we are in has recently become a social thing. I could barely find actual information about the class and also became very uncomfortable with the topics I had to scroll through. One of the women in our group is in her 40s-50s and started sending screenshots of her and her ex husband arguing through text, along with sharing information that I am just *not* interested in.. 

I texted our self proclaimed group leader about how I was uncomfortable having to scroll through this amount of messages, which contained triggering topics for me, just to be able to figure out what our group is deciding in the class. She essentially told me that it wasn't her fault that I didn't want to be friends with everybody. ??? I just personally don't think I have to be friends with people I work with in college. I will be friendly, but none of them intellectually stimulate me enough to give a shit about their lives. Especially not enough to scroll through all their problems (that from my perspective could be very easily fucking avoided) just so I can have an understanding of what tf we're doing in the group.

I eventually proposed to the group that we make a separate group chat only for class related topics. I thought it was obvious I meant specific information regarding our assignments. The second group chat I made has now just become a second complain-about-class groupchat, just without the ex husband talk.

Screenshot explanations:
I could have sworn I was so blatant about what the second gc was for...

The first screen shot is an example of the things this woman twice our age would talk about.

The second screenshot is my proposal in the initial group chat to have a separate group chat just for class information. 

The third screenshot is the same woman immediately using the second groupchat to make fun of this fat kid in our class.

I only really posted the older women's texts because I just feel like she is way too old to be acting like this. She's obsessed with this one dude in class and always takes pictures of him to send to us. She reminds me of an old friend's mom who would try to be the ""cool mom"" but just came off as a total creep. Like I get it if you're lonely and sad but that's not college students half your age's problem, dawg.. And its worse that one of the other girls will almost egg her on.

I completely ignore this woman anytime she tries to trauma dump on us. One of the girls is 17, still in highschool for crying out loud and this woman will talk to us about nsfw shit and just LOAD her trauma onto us. Idc if I seem heartless. Get friends your own age, weirdo.

~

I'll admit that most of what was bothering me was the explicit talk of abuse but jfc. I just feel like they're all so oblivious. I talked to one of the other girls who doesn't talk in the group chat unless it's about schoolwork and she agrees that the texting is annoying. 

I'm just going to deal with it until the end of this semester bc as long as there's not explicit texts about abuse, Ill be fine. But oh my fucking bro I hate these people.. I'm so hoping theres a group-rating at the end of the semester. 


We have the worst group grade out of the entire class bc all they do is make excuses for being lazy and complain ab our poor old professor. The class is so easy, dawg, they just spend more time talking shit than actually working. I get it, your life is miserable. Ugh I hate them 😭

40,ALEKS is the worst Math Program in existence ,14,"“Self Paced learning” my ass. Convoluted explanations and a half assed learning experience fits the bill more. SiteJabber has over 1,800 ratings on this program and guess how many have more than one star. *Less than 100*. This program is pure unadulterated brain torture and makes anyone who even has a slight interest of getting better in Math lose it. 

Let’s talk about what self paced means, “Done or designed to be accomplished at the students own speed”. This is basically what is being told what ALEKS is all about, but in reality it isn’t. You can’t relearn or revisit *any* topics you’ve lost through a Knowledge Check until you finish your current weeks topics, which just forces the student to learn new shit without fully understanding the previous concepts to connect it with. ALEKS whole web design is *so* outdated, not to mention the fucking video explanations for the questions seem like they were made when Peyton Manning was still throwing the ball in a Colts uniform.

Your professor basically sits back and does absolutely nothing, just watches time fly by and gets paid for it. All for an AI to not explain *WHY* the question works this way, which is funny because that’s the *entire* point of Mathematics, the why and the how do they work. ALEKS just gives you the problem, shows the steps and calls it good. That’s not how mathematics work. Especially Algebra and above.

After days of feeling guilty, I finally manage to motivate myself to write the introduction. Then I feel like I’m completely done with the paper, but oh wait, I still have 5 more sections to go. 

This process has happened to me every single time I have written a paper and knowing that fills me with deep dread whenever I’m assigned one.

Ever since the beginning of last year I knew that I wanted to take a semester off to figure out what I really wanted to do, since I could barely figure out what I wanted to major in. I knew I didn't know enough to understand the things I would be learning and that I wasn't mature enough to move 5 hours away from my hometown.And I was right. I have been studying for about two months and I'm failing out of most of my classes. I have gotten straight out zeros in my first midterms even after studying all day everyday. Not to blame it on my professors, but it also doesn't help when they only show slideshows and don't actually care to explain things to us. They don't even have office hours I can go to.
I'm also incredibly attached to my family and pets and honestly the homesickness is only getting worse. I came back home for a week and I just don't want to leave anymore. I don't want to feel alone anymore.
I'm so angry that no one thought to listen to what I really wanted to do. I feel like if I had more time to prepare myself I wouldn't be doing this badly.

I then sent her an email to make sure she approved of my extended time on tests and quizzes since I have accommodations. Rather than saying exams aren’t timed, she emailed me asking if I even opened up the quiz and tried it. Personally, I’d never take an exam if I’m not 100% sure of its parameters.

I was also having trouble for the first couple of weeks going through the assignments on the learning portal. Many of the readings/videos were listed with duplicate titles, and I’d end up clicking on the same link 2x since the hyperlinks don’t turn purple when clicking.

I emailed her giving her feedback back that it’s been a little difficult to navigate with her current layout, and she was able to change it without an issue. She then posted a video the next day saying she wanted feedback but not on how to do the layout of the learning portal. I had to request access to the video and wasn’t able to see it until a couple days later when she finally granted me access.

I feel so embarrassed now, I don’t know if I’m just being so sensitive or if I should take offense. I’m the only black person in the class.

I suppose this is more of a rant than anything… maybe looking for advice or insight. This isn’t about my hall, but rather my boyfriends. We live in the same building. A few doors down from him there is someone who lives in a single. He smells. BAD. Indescribable BO smell. This wouldn’t be an issue if it only was in his own room, however it makes the entire half of the hallway smell putrid. In my boyfriend’s room, (and likely other people’s too) you can get whiffs of it. 

My bf has reached out to his RA wondering if there was anything that could be done. Of course this can be a touchy subject because the person may be having a difficult time or have depression. I have some sympathy for that as someone with depression myself. This doesn’t make it smell any better though! The RA said that both them and the hall director were aware of the issue already. However, this was months ago and nothing has happened. It’s even gotten worse. I suppose it’s not bad enough for me to personally do something about this but it feels like a potential biohazard or something.

i stay in a dorm with my blockmates. we used to be friends up until an incident last february. we talked things through and i thought that the problem is already resolved. my college underwent a small semestral break, and after the break, the class met in one subject face to face since some of the class is still conducted online. from there i confirmed that they kicked me out of the friend group. new gc and all. im in 2nd year and the class is already divided among circles and i simply cant join other circles. holy week break happened and next week we will finally conduct face to face for a week and i don't know what to do. i lost motivation in studying and i dont want to stay in the dorm. my house is 3 hours away from school and going back and forth for a week is really tiring, especially since we will have 2 exams next week. can i do it?

53,group projects are stupid ,377,"i’m seriously losing my mind.

we got assigned this group project about a week ago, and i was put into a group with 3 other people. i reached out to them on MONDAY, when the project was assigned. i gave a few ideas for how we should divide the work, and one person responded 2 DAYS LATER asking to let him know what questions he would be assigned. FIRST OF ALL, what do i look like? i’m not ASSIGNING you shit, look at the list of problems and pick a few to answer. i ain’t getting paid for this.

so i responded and said that (but in a way nicer way) and chose my questions to answer. the thing with this project is that we all need to discuss the basics before we answer our questions, to make sure we all have the same take in our answers. so i give a suggestion for what we could do for that in the email as well.

RADIO SILENCE FOR TWO DAYS. it is now friday (yesterday). two of the team members still haven’t even responded to any email. so i sent another follow-up email, saying we needed to talk about the POV we would be taking on for this project. nobody responds again. 

so i email the prof at like 7am today, with screenshots of all of the emails i’ve sent (and the one i received). i asked if i could please do this assignment on my own, because i don’t know what to do when two people won’t respond and the one person that DOES doesn’t actually contribute anything.

no answer from prof yet. a few hours later the guy that initially responded to the first email responded again, and just chose the questions he would be answering. no information or suggestions about the POV we would be taking. like, im at such a loss here.

i refuse to do all of the work in this project and carry my team to a passing grade when they refuse to put any effort in. this is worth 20% and it’s due in two days and we have NOTHING written down because nobody is responding to my suggestions and/or giving suggestions of their own. the whole point of this assignment is to demonstrate teamwork, but i literally have no idea what to do. this is an online class and the only way i can contact my team is via email, which they refuse to respond to.

i just really hope my prof responds. should i email him and update him that one student responded (with once again, unhelpful input)? i don’t want to make it seem like im screwing this one guy over, but at the same time, even tho he’s the only one answering, he is still not helping (or even trying to). if he never responded to a single email, i would be in the exact same position. no feedback or ideas on the take we should have, which is the main part of the assignment. i’m so frustrated. who decided group work is a good idea in college??? i’m so beyond stressed out. it’s easter fucking weekend and i’m probably gonna have to spend it writing this giant paper on my own. and SINCE it’s easter weekend, my prof probably won’t even respond. i just don’t know what to do anymore. i would SAY i would complete the assignment with the one team member that has responded, but he hasn’t made any input and is only looking out for himself. didn’t even respond to my suggestions, let alone make his own. ugh 

UPDATE: he ignored my emails but sent out a mass email saying he hasn’t received any updates on any of the groups. like i fucking sent you updates already… i’m so pissed off right now. he won’t even help me and i don’t know what to do. i replied to his email asking him to check his inbox 

UPDATE 2: he responded and said he’s out of town and will read my emails tomorrow. which is when the assignment is due. so fml. i’m just gonna do my part and see if i can do more work too so i get a good mark. thanks everyone for the kind comments and suggestions! ",Sad-Character4424

55,Group members aren't participating? Nothing new.,4,"I have an online class and the professor has tried to make it a group project for the final. Part of the instructions were to decide amongst ourselves out of the category the professor gave us what we want to do our project on. Myself, and maybe one other person has said something about voting so that we are all doing the same thing. We've made posts multiple times with no response and after this week we only have four weeks left before the end of the semester so we really need to get started. One girl has just decided to go off on her own, and if no one is saying anything I might have to do the same. 

I've been lucky up until this point with group projects and haven't had any issues. I know I can't make anyone participate, but you would think if they were paying thousands they would want to. I can't decide if I should even bother with a group message or just go off on my own and let the professor know what's happened. ",ohtimorousme
56,Is there a way to be okay with the fact that I’m the only one of my friends without an internship this summer?,67,"
I’m a junior in college and every single one of my friends is doing something cool in their field over the summer. Some of them are having internships, and my best friend is gonna be at an REU all summer doing research in his field. Every single one of them is doing… well, something.

Except me. I’m going to be stuck at home, more than likely doing summer classes to help boost my poor GPA (a result of a few AWFUL semesters after getting diagnosed with OCD) and getting on track with credits I’m behind in because I declared my major (Computer Science) late. 

I feel like shit. My parents and I tend to bicker often, I have no friends from high school, and I can’t drive. I will basically just be stuck in my room for four months with absolutely no one. 

I’m looking on the negative side, I know, but as happy as I am for them I can’t help but also just feel sad that I’m the failure. I’m the one who can’t do well in classes, I’m the one who’s behind, I’m the one who wouldn’t have even had a chance to get accepted into any REU or internship. 

I got one interview. One. One that, in all honesty, I could’ve probably gotten, but I got scared and didn’t even move forward with it. Because all of my friends have no issues dropping everything to go anywhere.



if it’ll help benefit their future plans. They don’t care if it’s at a new place where they don’t know anyone. They all LIKE that. They LIKE the new experience, the independence. It just makes me scared. I know I can’t control it. I know it’s a product of the OCD and being autistic that it might just be something I can’t handle and everyone says that’s “okay” but that doesn’t make me any less frustrated with the fact that everyone is able to do something that seems so simple and yet I can’t. 

It sucks. I could get offered the most amazing, highest paying, coolest internship exactly in my interest field and if it still meant I’d be in a city with people I don’t know and nothing I’m familiar with, I would deny it without question. Wouldn’t even take me a second to think about it. Of course, that’s if I was even qualified enough to get those things, which unlike my friends who have great grades and experiences and recommendations, I have none of. 

They keep trying to get me to look on the bright side. “What’s one summer without us compared to graduating after us?” and “Don’t think about it like four months. It’ll just make you upset.” 

I just feel like my college experience has been a waste considering I have next to nothing to show for it. I don’t really know if there is a bright side I can keep looking for if the reason I’m in this position in the first place is because of myself.",lawfullytired
57,My art professor is so scatterbrained that he can't run class,460,"This class only meets once a week for three (3) hours each time. The first class was great and set what I thought would be the tone for the rest of the semester. We went through different drawings and practiced a few still lifes. Keep in mind this is literally an introduction to the principles of art and design. We are supposed to be learning the basics. This professor has cancelled class at least a third of the time, and for the last 6 classes or so has vaguely talked about a ""project"" that we will get information for on Canvas. We have never been assigned any work except for a few random textbook readings and responses. He will cancel class mere hours before we are actually supposed to meet, and when we do have class, he often ends class an hour or two before it's actually supposed to end. Worst of all, and not even his fault, the school didn't put this class in a studio, it's literally just in some random classroom. I'm just frustrated. I genuinely was looking forward to this class and it's important for my major. I'm annoyed that this is what my tuition is going towards.

I always draw all the figures by myself. Do all the editing and booked the recording room in uni. Design additional 3D models to show in presentation. Finding books in the library as resources. I even went to the factory for on-site observation. I learn skills as I go through the process. No one teach me to do these. I do it because I cared. 

The professor always said, it is important for you to learn how to make poster, to work in a group, etc. However, under unit outline written in black and white. It said “Assignment not hurdle to pass, and makes up 20% only.”. Instead of putting effort into group work that’s not valued. Maybe we should put more effort on the final exam. Final exam is hurdle and group work isn’t. No matter how much the professor says, it won’t changed how it is valued.",CottonCandySheep101
63,what was i supposed to do differently here?,8,"okay, this happened in a class that i took last semester and it makes me mad every time i think about it so i want to get it off my chest. but first i need to give context to the story first;

so i'm taking planetary astronomy for my last science credit and we have to make a presentation on a spacecraft and i picked stardust. not to hype myself up (but to hype myself up because college is miserable after awhile), my presentation was pretty good! i did not leave out a single detail and answered every question to the best of my knowledge. i noticed i got one point taken off in one section (can't remember for the life of me) so i decided to ask her after class because i was doing really bad in the class and wanted to keep getting perfect scores so i could stay afloat. i said something along the lines of ""hey! i noticed i got a 4/5 instead of a 5/5 on this section so i'm just wondering what i did so i can do better my next presentation."" and she got weirdly scared and, kept backing off then started saying stuff like ""but you got a good grade?"" and i remember being a little annoyed and wondering if it was supposed to be some lesson to be happy with my good work. hell, i'm still wondering. and before you say anything, i'm usually fine with getting bad grades but i like to know what i did wrong exactly to fix it for the future so i get a decent grade instead. i'm not really all too annoyed because yeah, i got a good grade overall but it still is just weird she refused to tell me why she graded my presentation like that.

NOW onto the actual thing i'm still mad about. so the last presentation was about moons and my moon was calypso. quick fun fact, not a lot is known about it's discovery besides some key details (when and who). the main thing is that the telescope was never named and was simply listed as a ""ground-based"" telescope (astronomy people understand why this says absolutely nothing). that's what it said on NASA's website and literally every other place i looked. so i did my presentation in class and i thought i did great until i got my grade. there were 5 possible points for the discovery section and i got 3. i was just so incredibly confused and i still am. my main theory is that she just didn't believe me when i said i didn't know what telescope was used to discover it and marked me down for it. there was only so much information i could put on there since it's just a trojan moon that follows a bigger moon. i never asked because the experience before and it was the last one so big deal. it still just completely confuses me because i reread her notes like it was scripture and nowhere did it insinuate that i wasn't explaining enough. should i have looked up what telescopes were commonly used by scientists in the 80s to narrow it down and make it up? or should i have personally called NASA and asked them what telescope it was?? or should i have gotten a time machine to ask the scientists themselves what telescope they're using so i can put it into a presentation in the future??? how would i even begin to CITE THAT? i know i could have lied but i thought professors were to... i dont know... LOOK at the sources in your works cited to see if you're making things up? i always go in with that mindset of ""they'd call me out on my bullshit"" because every time i have done it, they've called me out for it.  

tl;dr 

professor marks me down once and i ask then she never explains to me what the problem was. come next presentation, im marked down even more for not knowing something that's never been recorded. still confused on what it possibly could have been.",ThatOneDorkThatDraws

They walked into the room pointed at me and said loudly, ""there's no point in you being here"". I was upset by this and they continued by telling me that we could talk outside the class as if they hadn't just announced to the class I had failed. I told them that I thought their behavior was bad and they just told me that mine was too. I don't think me not attending a class deserves a public shaming and to be insulted in front of a group of my peers. It's been a bit since this happened and I am still extremely distraught by the entire situation and don't know what to do.

well my prof is taking off points for all of us. I emailed him telling them the other group members and i had no involvement in that part and I think it’s unfair for us to have points taken off for a group members mistake, but I haven’t gotten a response yet.

when I asked the group if they saw the email about us plagiarizing a part of the poster, the person that plagiarized the part said that they “didn’t know they had to rewrite it” (this is for a 4000 level chem class, which makes this hard to believe)

I don’t party but I love hanging with friends. I knew going in as a commuter that it would be harder to make friends but I didn’t think it would be THIS hard.

This semester, I’ve been having an extremely hard time in my physics class. I was barely holding on to the minimum grade for an A, until this point. I just did a lab, didn’t even finish on time, and got such an absurdly high error that it was laughable. I genuinely don’t foresee myself getting above a 5/20.  This is going to tank my grade by about 1.5 percentage points, which is unaffordable given my current grade.

I’m just devastated. There is no reasonable path forward to an A for me, unless I get practically 100 on my next exam and the final. This is not going to happen because I ALWAYS lose a good chunk of points no matter how many absurd hours I study for my exams.

I've been forcing myself to every one of my classes and forcing myself to eventually get onto all my assignments but it's so hard to get through it all when my brain can only see me as a waste of space for being such a procrastinator. 

Throughout college and years before I have been depressed, socially anxious and suicidal where I hoped the focus on my studies would rid me of those thoughts. It didn't and has made it worse.

Anyway so I think I've fucked up majorly because of all this annoying depression and stuff. I've done feck all in terms of my readings and my dissertation due on May 8th I've only done a bit of reading for and never had the courage to talk with my supervisor because honestly she scares me and I don't really know how to talk to lecturers much.

69,Just over it,47," I’m finishing undergrad, planning on grad school, only to learn that I’m taking grad level classes because they’re all undergrad/grad, same class, just a different number and one extra paper for grad students. Are you kidding me? These classes are a joke. 

One is supposed to be a historical lit survey and it seems all we do is listen to the prof rant about politics, or whatever comes up that day. They constantly push back due dates because we haven’t covered material, leaving us with nothing to do for weeks, then having a bunch of big assignments all in one week because that’s when the dates were pushed to. 

This prof cancels class more than we have it, and I cant believe I’m going into debt for this. They’re also tenured, so no one really cares what they do. Let’s add that every time they push back a due date they ask the class if we appreciated it, and we’re all supposed to say that we did. No, I don’t appreciate the delayed due date, and I don’t appreciate being asked to appreciate it. I’d appreciate them teaching per the syllabus plan and holding themselves and us to that. If a student was out as much as this prof, we’d be asked to withdraw. 

 I’m just baffled that all this isn’t considered a scam. The system is fucked. We’re not learning, and no one cares. If a prof tries to hold us to a higher standard, they’ll probably get trashed on rmp and in evals. It’s just messed up. Thank you for letting me rant.

72,What the hell is wrong with college admins (TW for SA),27,"I (20M) decided to restart my education at a community college after taking a semester off for mental health concerns and one thing I've observed that both of my colleges have in common is there are assaulters walking around scot-free. There were a couple examples I came to learn about today after attending a discussion on sexual assault on college campuses, and the shocking part was a few of these people I heard about I actually have met and interacted with.

Justin-I had heard he openly did indecent acts on campus and harassed girls into giving phone numbers. The crazy part is that I had a conversation with him that morning not knowing what his true colors were.

Chris-I had met this fellow once when talking to a few classmates in my Intro to Business class and he was present, despite not being in our class. Little did I know he loitered in the campus and abused resources (Chris is not a registered student). One of the club admins said they caught him soliciting sexual favors from minors, and they were able to confirm the same by posing as a teenage girl. Oh yeah, the cherry on top is that he sent a >pic of him with a strap-on< and lamented people were being unfair/transphobic after he was called out. I was talking to a couple acquaintances and they said they both knew him and he had done similar things in their high school. Might I add Chris kept hitting on femme-presenting people with no regard to if they were into him. 

Harsh-I have not met him in person but have heard he is blatantly ableist, fetishizing and racist. Harsh assisted another student in harassing girls. Crazy part is he is in my major.

Vinay-Was a perpetrator and harassed many girls for cell phone numbers. I saw at least 20 hands go up saying they had a negative experience with him at the mention of his name. 

After hearing all this I was astounded since I had thought this problem would not be as prevalent in this college (which I have more examples of assaulters at my previous college), but I was still not happy upon hearing this, especially with my own experiences with SA in an educational institution. The admins at this discussion said that it's a good thing to report because ""regardless if the assaulter gets punished there is a paper trail"", when such acts should not occur at all in the first place. Unbelievable that this is so accepted and such people get to roam around scot free, part of what contributed to my mental health issues at my previous college. Another person I met at the discussion said that she left her previous college for similar reasons and the admins refused to take any punitive action, since I had shared my story.

I have a 4.0 gpa and am biology major. I applied to my schools scholarship and got $500 which I thought was good considering how little I spend on community college.

Anyway, I got in an argument with my mom. Who keeps comparing me to my thousands of cousins who all supposedly have gotten full ride scholarships. And she keeps talking about why I don't have any. When I explained to her I did have one she laughed it off as not a real scholarship.

Then she started yelling that I am just a lazy bum who doesn't want to apply to scholarships (I always apply for local ones) she just keeps sending some fake or lottery chance scholarships where it's like win 10k! and I ignore them because those are pointless.

But anyway with university coming up, I do want to get scholarships (obviously) and I have applied through my schools portal, but am wondering if I should do more?

Is it really easy as my mom presumes is, and am I just not 'putting in the effort' by not branching out of local ones??

I was slapped in the face by a mid term project I ended up procrastinating on, and the day before it was due, got sick and on the day it was due I could hardly think.

moving forward, the project felt overwhelming. I didn’t start it until the evening of today, which is two days in before the extension is over.

My first day in person I went to school and immediately got so stressed from all the people around that I cried in the bathroom for 25 minutes. I cried for longer yesterday because it feels like I never get a break. I haven't had a day where I haven't had something eminently due in months. 

I haven't had any of the ""fun"" parts of college because it's a community college. It's just a loud place that gives me work and makes me cry.

We have this crappy professor in a Comp Sci class who hasn’t graded any of the 6 assignments this semester nor the midterm. Supposedly the dean was up his ass last week to have them posted and we still haven’t received anything. Keep in mind this is a relatively small class too. Only about 20 students.

80,going through a huge brainrot during midterms,9,"So since the beginning of this semester I've barely attended any classes and I haven't really been self studying opting to rot in bed for days on end and occasionally watch shows/movies till 6am... 
For context I've been dealing with depression for a very long time and no I'm not treated for it my parents don't think it exists after all :)
Anyways fall semester I was okay constantly on the grindset then I got sick and couldn't attend classes and failed some exams then all my willpower disappeared. Spring comes alonge and it got so much worse... And it's definitely screwed me over cuz I've missed multiple quizzes and assignments.. but I just don't have the motivation to do anything. And now I have midterms and I haven't studied for it. Part of me is thinking of just skipping some exams and maybe going for a make-up idk maybe by then I'll get my shit together... kinda wish I could take a leave of absence for the remainder of the semester but alas I can't, just stuck in this hellhole and my so called friends and roommates aren't helping either it's like their thoughts are essentially ""gee I wonder why this person keeps staying in bed all day zoning out, not Taking a shower and not doing anything else everyday hmmm what could that possibly mean?

82,Getting Internships Should Not Be This Difficult ,21,"I just got a rejection call from an internship that I applied for, even though I had good (and relevant) experience for it and completed two interview rounds. How much experience do companies want college students to have? To even get an internship nowadays you need experience. Imagine needing experience for an internship. I’ve been busting my ass trying to accumulate part time work and internship experience ever since I changed majors 3 years ago, and my experience still isn’t enough? Like what else am I really supposed to do? 

It feels like the only way to get a secured internship is through a program like SYEP (Summer Youth Employment Program) that actually seeks to place students in an internship. I got my first paid internship through them in the same field of work that I just got rejected from. If it weren’t for a program like SYEP, I think I’d continue to get rejected from solid, paid internships from LinkedIn. Only getting unpaid internships. 

Like this shit is so frustrating. People love to shout from the mountaintops that college students need to do internships, but don’t realize that EVEN WITH EXPERIENCE, companies are still rejecting college students from INTERNSHIPS.

83,Professor hasn't responded to emails in two weeks,34,"We had a major assignment due February 25th and it finally got graded March 14th. Of course this happened to be the day directly before our drop date, March 15th, and the TA had given me a zero for the assignment due to some shortcomings on their part. The code written performed correctly to the standards so I emailed the professor the same day, March 14th for a regrade request.

I'm not sure what else I should do now but I have sent two follow up emails since March 14th with no response back. Others have received same day responses and I have checked I am actually sending the emails to the correct email address. I talked to my advisor and she told me there wasn't much she could do besides continuing to send emails or what for an in-person class to happen and ask her in person. My concern is that if shes ignoring emails, how easy will it be for her to say she forgot what I told her in person. Should I just keep sending email follow ups her way I should I give up on my advisor and CC our department head to see if that gets something going?

TL;DR assignment is worth a majority of final grade, got a shocking zero, professor hasn't responded in nearly two weeks, advisor didn't give much info.",CMOS_BATTERY
84,f*ck my prof,363,"dude's resume is a f\*cking joke. Basically he got every project management cert and plastered it all over his linkedin page. He even included it in his name and he tells us that this is the best way to get noticed by potential employers. Bro your linkedin page looks like a classified ad there's nothing professional about it.

But the part that really grinds my gears. I missed class for one day because there was nothing scheduled in class that day. He moves the due date of an assignment to be due to that day and makes it so only those in class gets marks for it. 5% gone just like that.

Then he assigns me into a group that does jack shit, fine whatever. I finished every assignment give it to the group leader and he changes font colors and says he contributed. Everyone puts their name on it and hands it in. But what really triggers me, I complete another assignment a week in advance gave it to the group leader. Dude forgets to hand it in. Prof gives the entire group a zero. What the f\*ck. Basically lost 10% for absolutely no reason except the prof is just power tripping for no reason.  I fricking hate group projects.

\*edit i'll leave this comment here because somehow people are justifying changing assignments/submission dates from their original date to spite students.

attendance isn't mandatory in the lecture class. We have a lab class that is meant for doing group work. He cancelled all our lab classes because he doesn't want to go to school another day. So he just makes labs due on that lab date and lecture is lecture. All the submission due dates are still the lab class except this one lab because he decided in the class to reinforce attendance that day. That is why the schedule/syllabus still has the original due date and the original submission date was set to the lab date. I checked all of those dates before deciding to skip class that day. Also work called me in that day and they are paying for my tuition while still paying a salary so I really can't skip on them. I",Intelligent_Wedding8

93,Professor Rant ,298,"Hi everyone,

So I randomly got diagnosed with a serious illness that's thankfully curable, but it's a lengthy process to eradicate.

I've been attending so many doctor's appointments because of how serious it is and it's causing other illnesses as well. There's one particular class that legitimately starting to piss me off and the TA is getting on my last nerve. I had to take an exam and I had to leave early because I became gravely ill during the middle of it. I made him known of my condition before classes started.

Every other professor has been accommodating even before ADS was involved. He told me I can't retake the exam because it's unfair to the other students. My other professors have not only given me extra time, but they are letting retake exams whenever because of how serious this is. To make matters worse the TA grades so hard and unfairly that every single student in the class is getting mad. I checked my work with other students in my class and we all did the same exact thing but I received a lower score? I emailed her about it and she was snappy with me.

Mind you she was in the wrong and the professor had to change my grade. She's not even a student but she's a TA!

How would you guys handle this? My accommodations took effect the day before spring break started and ADS is so fucking slow when it comes to getting you the necessary accommodations!

94,College Ceremony Honors Distinction: ,14,"Hello. 

Honestly I’m livid right now so pardon for the rant here:

So basically my school screwed me last minute on my academic planning so I was left with taking core classes (21 units my last semester) so I can graduate on time. Luckily I’m doing really well with (three A’s), (three A-‘s), and (one A+) putting my cumulative GPA as of now at a solid 3.73 if I account for midterm grades but with my gpa recorded from last semester (Fall) which it’s at a 3.68. 

I’m so mad because I assumed that honors at my graduation ceremony this May would equate from the total GPA I earn after finals this spring, but after some DEEP research, I found a clause saying that they only recognize honors placement by GPA all the way up to the Fall semester, not Spring. 

Do any of you people out there have this clause for your college/university? Or is my school just the outlier here with this policy. ",sna1ph
95,fuck group projects,74,"So my international relations professor decided it was a brilliant idea to make our papers group projects. The first group should be 2-3 people, the second paper is 4-6 people, and then the third is 10-12 people. In my previous group for the first paper, I was with A and M, and when I reached out to them after the first paper, we planned to continue with this group and simply add members/merge with another group. I received no communication from either A or M, so I started reaching out repeatedly to A (the only person whose contact info i had) over the course of the past week in order to start work on our paper (it's due this Thursday). I reached out to M today and received news that they had joined another group that only had room for two members - two weeks ago. And now I'm on the verge of a mental breakdown because who will let me into a group with most papers already finished 🫠

I reached out to my professor to see if he could help me with a solution and the one person I know in this class to see if I could maybe join his group but it's Sunday so I might not get responses until Tuesday (when I have class)

Worst case scenario I have to write a 1500-word paper in two days, but I've certainly done more in less time so we'll see.



Update! My professor emailed me back, saying that I was welcome to do this project on my own if I wanted to, but that I could join a group and go over the limit as well. Luckily neither of those were necessary as the one person I know in this class had a spot in his group and it sounds like they have enough to do still that I will be a meaningful contributor :)",Outrageous_Woods
96,Mcgraw hill is the enemy of fundamentally understanding something ,61,"i'm autistic and currently in as sociology class I absolutely love my teacher and what we learn in classes incredibly valuable but it's the McGraw Hill aspect of it that's making me want to tear my hair out and scream. 

The phrasing of questions, and the ways that we are meant to answer do not MAKE SENSE TO ME. I feel like I'm being Pranked or something with the ways that I'm supposed to answer these questions. I feel like I'm answering a captcha question.  Answers that should be reasonably understood that could be corrected. I am automatically referred back to the book but the book does not fully fundamentally explain what's happening. I feel like I'm not actually learning anything. I am just copying and pasting. 

The way that these questions are phrased the way that I have to answer. Makes me feel like a rat in a cage. Sociology is a broad subjective and matter of learning that IS IMPOSSIBLE. answer the question about conducting research was saying that oh ""look for mistakes that other researchers have made"" but no, that's wrong but like... you should be.

97,It's hard coming to terms with the fact that you're college experience was a failure in every facet.,427,"Normally, people will lament that their colleges experiences were not as enjoyable, socially successful, professionally successful, or academically successful as they should have been, but usually they were able do well in at least one of those areas. 

Personally, I didn't get good grades and didn't even have a particularly difficult or marketable major. I didn't land relevant internships or develop a career plan. I didn't graduate on time, and went into a ton of debt in the process that I'll likely never pay back. I didn't do much networking. I didn't build any strong or last social bonds. I didn't even enjoy most of my experience at college. I had so many opportunities to make something out of this experience, and fumbled every single one. Now I'm about to graduate, and I can't be happy about it because it's a reminder that I failed in every dimension you could possibly fail.

99,My college social life is basically done (also my fault there),17," (I didn't know this sub existed lmfao)

I don't even know what the fuck is wrong with me most of the time. I am in dorms my freshman year of college and as of then it was fine. 
But two of my roomates, M and D, they ended up ranting a lot or had a lot of jokes regarding dark humor shit (possible harm or smthn that came across to people but like it wasn't in a serious way???) My dumbass regrettably went along with a lot of it even if it wasn't what I was really thinking (I kind of just kept it in mind that it's a joke yknow)

Then this one roomate J, they also ended up kind of being quiet from the very beginning, a lot of conversation just felt one sided when it came to starting things or something like that. I came home the weekends when class was over. 

Well we had issues with chores, M and D ever only really rarely did these chores, I tried to stay consistent with the bathroom (but like you know the bathroom getting dirty real easily, that stuff) and then M makes the biggest mess in the kitchen which somehow she's even been shit at cleaning that up and then doing the dishes she was shit at doing that constantly. 

J even though there was shit that could have been done or smthn she also did just keep at the whole dishes thing D was supposed to sweep but somehow she rarely did that 

Well I ended up trying to ask everyone what they did around the dorm room, I talked with J as the final result then boom boom whole new chorelist before Christmas break

Well after Christmas break chore list was done but january stage everything was okay-ish 

Well then when J had to go on a trip back in feburary-march M decides to tell me that J likely was talking shit about me because somehow O had went up to them and was like '(my name) is the odd one out' or smthn along those lines

Well, here's the thing too, J never initiates any conversation, J leaves for hours without saying shit and I'd have to text to make sure everything was all good, I tried to be nice as possible to J but then trying to initiate every single convo with someone is tiring 

Well now then I was like 'yknow what fuck them' and then we all simultaneously went to not really say much when they're around

Last Wednesday they end up leaving or some shit moving stuff out of dorm to go in the other dorm and I had to head to class (had a night class) and then eventually M and D texted me like saying shit happened they'll tell me when I get back or smthn

Well now it's shit that J has said, a last comment like 'Thanks for nothing y'all' which set them off, then D ends up playing the race card (her quotes) and emails the temporary Dean (a whole other situation)

(I was on call during this whole meeting and not in person)

Well meeting happens Saturday, turns out J decides to end up painting the entire thing as something 100% we were expected to constantly talk to her because even though she never speaks to us, we constantly ended up making plans and then didn't invite her to (which they actually tried to invite her, but okay.) My whole thing with that was that things can't be one sided 

And I wasn't even in on any of those plans either most the time, I went out like (twice?? With M and D) 

Then the more understandable part is the whole jokes thing for J not feeling comfortable with that, which I understand, but then J begins to say shit like we were genuinely wanting to harm her or some shit like that, which D ends up wording shit like it was a whole bonding experience with the dark humor bits (???) 

Then what's even more fucked up regarding this is that M and D NEVER say shit at all during the whole dorm time I've been with them. So now I feel dragged in in a way as a result ??? 

Anyway then J begins to say how M kept sleeping which had J do the dishes, which that part is true, but then J begins to say she was picking up shit (???) And then m and d never even fucking said shit after that, I'm on call which my hearing is shit as a result (Microsoft teams+earbuds)

Then J ends up saying shit how she was like the only one making change or some shit (No??? She never even brought up shit at all.) And then in the meeting she began to word shit like (how it sounded to me) that me and her were texting a bunch (we werent)

I'm just kind of done and drained as a result of everything. Ik a lot of shit I've said isn't good too. I see a lot of wrongs between both parties but now I'm just like I don't even know anymore

**Things to add on: a lot of times M and D ended up adding onto the joking part where they joked about harm onto someone, I'll add that onto the post. I regrettably participated and went on also in some of those.**

Edit for people who ended up saying they didn't understand things from the post, here is a reply I had that the person ends up saying was more coherent:

We didn't spend the entire semester talking about hurting peers, the most of it was outright shittalking making fun of the person from the stuff that I remember. Toward the beginning of the year or actually just from the first month or whatnot and on forward we had to initiate every single conversation with her. 

We eventually gave up (or actually M and D did) and then in the beginning of February when J had to go to a trip M told me that it was likely J was talking shit about me to other people due to what a friend who isn't there said to her about me being the odd one out or some shit, then that's when I ended up giving up on trying to talk to her. 

Well after all the silence J moves out and we werent notified abt it. Well in the meeting that's where J's apparent silence came from but then she starts saying how we never invited her to places which we did she just said no, then that's when she ends up saying also we talked abt death on another person (The most I remembered was this one creep that we genuinely wished death upon, the rest was a lot of shittalking) and then how J felt like a maid apparently and was cleaning up everything and picking up trash

Here's the thing though J wasn't constantly picking up trash, the most was that she just kept doing the dishes second semester. 1st semester was where I could see that holding up but I stuck to my own chore of doing the bathroom and if she cleaned the bathroom it was on the weekend. 
Then 1st semester was when we discussed the chore thing again

If it still sounds confusing here I'm sorry

102,I’m so tired of guys cutting in front of me in the dining hall!,216,"Idk why but recently guys have started cutting in front of me (20F) in the dining hall when we’re all waiting for our food.

This has happened to me 3 separate times and I’m already over it. Is it really that difficult to just wait patiently like everyone else? It’s not even like I’m taking long to get my food, if anything I make sure to be quick about it.

They don’t even say excuse me or anything they just cut right in front of me. The worst part about it is that they literally see me standing there and do it anyway and say nothing. One time a guy cut in front of me so rudely that his friend called him out on it and that was the only time someone said sorry to me for cutting.

I have pretty bad social anxiety, especially from this year, so I usually try not to draw attention to myself but holy hell I’m not invisible! The weirdest thing about all of this is that this has NEVER happened to me before this year so I don’t understand why people are being so rude to me now.

Okay so I followed everyone’s advice and just asked her, which is probably the first thought for you non anxious people. She was kinda surprised that I brought it up, apparently she didn’t even realize she was doing it.

I’m basically by myself while everyone else sits a little further back. My professor is decently old and starting to loose her hearing. Since I was close and I’m pretty loud when I speak, she picked on me because she could actually understand my answer. She promised she’d spread out her questions more and give me a break. She’s been pretty chill since then and yesterday showed up with hearing aids. Holy shit is class 10x better. She isn’t half shouting anymore or “ignoring” our questions. It’s so so nice.

she spends three hours every class, reading off a powerpoint that has nothing but theory. she does have around 10-12 practice problems in the powerpoint, but she tends to skim and skip over them, saying “you do that at home and read it.” 

on top of the theory, she explains how to derive equations using a laser pointer and a bunch of letters- that FEEL like gibberish because i don’t understand where they’re from or how she got them. 


It’s infuriating, because she expects us, in a way, to understand how to solve problems that she’s never shown how to do. 

how do you guys deal with teachers like this? i just go home and watch other lecture videos but even then, im not even sure if im learning all that she wants us to understand by the next test. 

tldr; physics teacher doesn’t show how to do problems, expects us to understand and do them ourselves after pointing and reading theory off of a ppt.

105,Professor isn't giving us a spring break at all,73,"I'm in an asynchronous class, and recently realized that we have our usual weekly work due plus a quiz in the middle of break. We literally don't get a Spring Break at all. I realize it is what it is, but it's frustrating because I made plans assuming I'd get a break like the rest of my classes. (This class is also by far my most time consuming class to add the cherry on the top.) I feel like being in an asynchronous class doesn't mean I'm not entitled to a Spring Break just because there are no live meetings. What's the point of having a spring break if you're going to have the usual amount of work due during that week??

Update: I emailed the department head per the recommendation of a different proffesor when I asked her if she knew if professors were able to assign work due during break. The department head responded and asked for the class and section number and then said he contacted the professor to ask if it was an error. In hindsight, I realize I should’ve gone to the professor first, I just was having a hard time with knowing how to ask politely and she hasn’t responded to emails in the past. 

Update 2: The department head told me that the professor responded saying that the due dates were only for planning purposes, and students could work ahead or turn the assignment after spring break.

106,Rejected from all undergrad summer research I applied for ,24,"I just wanted to vent about this and didn’t know where the best place would be. 

I applied for 5 summer research positions and got the rejection email from the last one today. I don’t know what I did wrong; I had several people read my personal statements and help revise, I poured my heart and soul into my writing, and was clear what I wanted to get out of the opportunity and how it related to my goals. I got references and letters of recommendation and am very passionate about the subjects the opportunities focused on. 

I’m a junior so I can’t apply to them again, this was my first time applying to anything like this so it feels like I completely ruined my one and only chance for undergrad research. I feel so awful. I should’ve applied to more, I was told by an advisor that 5 is a good amount but I guess not. I should’ve tried harder somehow. I don’t know how to cope, I was so excited for them and spent so much time and effort for nothing.

107,Assessment got WEIGHTED DOWN,84,"NOTE: My department is like the teacher can do anything they want so plz dont torture me ""go to dean or head"" wont work 

TLDR: Professor swapped the Maximum Obtainable score and the weight of the assignment which brings everyone's grades down

Tried to tell but cant complain where I live so yeah cant do much. Idk how many have failed the course cause of this

To explain lets say the total of the assessment was 20 and I scored 14

As a final weight the prof decided to put that assessment's score out of 25 like 14/25 instead of 14/20

So instead of 17.5/25 i am getting a downgrade yippee to something like 11.6/20 So thats like increase of max points by 5 points but the difference is 6 points of my obtained score

Not to mention many student sucked in this assessment which maybe why he did that but actually this makes everyone's change to a bit worse. Got A GRADE LOWER because of it

The few weeks before getting the final grade sucked a lot going from B to C's. I previously bombed assignments and a max of 3 quizzes because of reason beyond my control however this takes the cake. 

Should've just increased the obtained marks along with total and everyone would be happy ",TechNerdinEverything
108,Why does no one know how to just get their clothes? ,22,"Usually whenever I need to do laundry throughout the week, I can manage to get them done no-problem, but I just sat in my dorm’s laundry room for over a fucking hour and a half waiting on people to come get their washed clothes out of the washing machines, and eventually just had to give up because I’ve got class soon and my clothes wouldn’t be done in time. 

There are people who are confident enough to move other people’s clothes into the dryers, but I swear if I weren’t a better person their stuff would have just gone straight in the trash. I don’t understand how people can be so fucking inconsiderate, especially with so many people needing to do their laundry. We literally have a floor groupchat specifically for coordinating laundry stuff, and I told these people MULTIPLE TIMES that their shit was ready, but they ignored me. 

I have literally never had this much trouble trying to do something as simple as laundry. ",BasalTripod9684
109,How do I not take everything as a personal attack? I’m constantly feeling everyone hates me in this club on campus. ,128,"
I’m a 21 y.o. woman in college in my junior year and it has been very hard for me to trust people, as in trust that they genuinely enjoy my presence. I talk to a woman regularly in the dean of students office and she thinks that it’s due to being bullied for years before college combined with my OCD and anxiety. I am on the waitlist to see a therapist but it will likely be awhile. 

My best friend just got back from a spring break trip with the hiking club on campus. I’ve been on a trip with this club in the past (small campus so small club), and they’re a pretty welcoming bunch. Despite this, I am absolutely convinced they all hate me. Not just “don’t know well,” *hate* me. 

As tradition after every hiking trip, they go out to eat and then throw a little party/get together. My friend and I (along with a few other friends of mine) all live in a house on campus, and my best friend told the hiking club that the party can be held there. I don’t care about that, it doesn’t bother me, but here’s where it gets a little complicated.

My best friend and I are very close. So, naturally, being away from each other for two weeks, we also missed each other a ton and have been catching each other up and stuff. We always get dinner together too, so we’re kind of just always around each other save for when one of us is at work or something. He wanted to get dinner with me today, but realized that the hiking club’s restaurant outing was today and that he wouldn’t be able to eat with me. He said something along the lines of that he would invite me along, but it’s probably best if I hang back since I didn’t go on the trip, but that I’m more than welcome to go to the party.

For any normal person this should be fine. My best friend is trying to include me without making me feel like the odd one out, which going to the restaurant with people who were on the trip as the one person who wasn’t would inevitably make me feel. He also said this would be a great time to get dinner with my other friends who would probably want me to hang out with them without my best friend being right next to me for a change. This is all understandable.

I know, reasonably, that this should be it. I should move on from there and just chill out. But I couldn’t help but get embarrassed that I even wanted to go eat with them in the first place, that they wouldn’t want me there anyways, etc etc etc. I always jump to it being a personal thing when it never was intended to be that way. My friend never said that he hates me or is uncomfortable by me, and even said I am more than welcome to go to the party and he will even walk to it with me so I’m not scared!!! He is being an amazing and supportive buddy to me and yet I am still getting insecure. Because now I feel like if they wouldn’t want me at the restaurant why would they want me at the party, even though he’s tried to explain that they wouldn’t be upset from a member of their club going to the club’s party. 

I know I’m making a mountain out of a molehill, and it sucks. I was hoping maybe someone here could see this from a new perspective and give me insight on how to handle this.

110,Being the only black person in a room,115," If there are any black people on this sub that can relate to the feeling I'm about to describe, please let me know how you deal with it.

I'm not sure why it affects me in this way, but something about normally being the only black person in a room at my college is really hitting right now. I attend UIUC, and I'm struggling in all aspects that are under my sole control. Mental, academic, etc. It's mid semester and I flunked two out of my four midterms, so I'm in the middle of trying to recuperate my grade before it's too late. I went the first part of the semester just trying to make friends, because my depression + social anxiety combo usually make it really hard to socialize. I found a group of people who'd been wanting me to join them, so I finally feel like I belong somewhere. But in the moments where it's time to lock in, email professors, and just exist alone in this environment, I feel like I'm always the outlier. I wonder if the people around me are judging me for how I look or dress, and I feel so much imposter syndrome because of it. Especially since I transferred in, and I'm just getting a feel for how to navigate being in this uni. I'm having a rough time communicating with professor's / TA's (none of whom look like me or probably interact with people like me on a regular basis). It's just too much and I feel really overwhelmed to the point that I'm crying in the library just writing this!

I grew up in a majority minority town. I've never had what people like to call a 'victim mindset,' but I do acknowledge systemic issues and their repercussions always. I just feel extremely isolated. I don't seek out black spaces often because on this campus it also feels like there's a 'specific way' to be black that people like. I just want to feel comfortable existing without being stuffed into a box! I love my people but I do not want to feel judged for not dressing a certain way or coming off in a certain way!

This is highkey just a rant: not having a great time academically and feeling like a sore thumb in these spaces doesn't help me feel any better about it. Thanks for reading this far.",No_Yogurtcloset_8350

I don't have a passion for coding even though it would be an awesome skill to have, *and I could make my own projects.* I have interests, but outside of my tabletop club it feels like I have little time to pursue them without some other project or assignment biting my ass.

I was assured by the department head that my complaint would remain anonymous, but it was a small class and if any specifics were mentioned they'd know exactly who submitted the complaint.   
I had a very negative experience with an instructor. They'd run through their poorly made slideshows as quickly as they could and then spend the rest of the class on their phone; completely tuning out the students. They had their nose in their phone 95% of the time and did not monitor anything the students were doing. It was like pulling teeth to get help. They laughed at me and were very dismissive when I asked questions.   
I ended up learning more from Google and random people I met on the internet than the ""expert"" I was paying. No help was offered. Low effort, ignored student needs, ignored students in general, played on their phone for the entirety of the session instead of roaming and assisting, didn't grade any work for the first month, and neglected to follow guidelines for classmates with disability accommodations.   **--What would you do?--**  


TL:DR; Horrible, disrespectful, distracted, and neglectful teacher. I want future students to have a better experience and/or have the teacher change their behavior (if not be replaced). I'm worried about reporting them because faculty in the department may label me as a whiner/someone who complains a lot, or there may be some form of retaliation if the teacher finds out I reported them.

127,Grades,6,"So I currently have a 3.69 gpa and I am in a biology class. I am due to declare my major (marine biology b.s.). 

I’ve had a cocktail of circumstances involving letting myself be pressured into working 4.5 hours 4 days a week, a sport which I let consume every single weekend. A 10 week schedule for which I stupidly took all heavyweight classes. trying to make time for friends and an ill-timed crush. And a car wreck on a cosigned vehicle (which I was luckily not injured nor was anyone else involved. It also was at a slow speed but it was still careless as I should not have been on that road in the rain and distracted).

In any case, I have been not my most academically locked in the quarter. I also ran out of my psych meds and was too lazy to renew my prescription two days after the accident. 

I am currently worried that I may fail this bio class (currently standing at a 79 I believe with a 20% final, which I am unsure I will be able to make over a 75% on. I got 79’s on both midterms and missed 1 assignment. Grade breakdown currently is 20% participation and homework- 98.99%, 20% midterm 1- 79%, 20% midterm 2- 78%, 20% final project- looking at ~75% or lower, with a 67% being incredibly possible (yes I fucked up here. It was one assignment out of, I shit you not, 10 homework pages. 10 self led quizzes. 5 section papers. 3 other project progress pieces. Probably around 160 content videos. And 2 midterms. I feel sick that I prioritized the quiz and homework over it. I procrastinated and had to do this, the quiz, and the homework. It was writing one paragraph. I ran out of time. I definitely could have done it easily. I want to be put through a woodchipper.)  and then 20% final grade. I am gonna give it my all on the final but here we are. My school counts anything under a 75% as failing for a STEM class. 

I feel miserable. I’ve been a solidly mostly-A’s student since highschool, maintained a 3.72 then. This would be the first class I’ve ever failed. I fucked it up and it’s my fault and I can’t shake the feeling that I don’t even deserve to be here. I’m a waste of space who is going to face an uphill battle to be employable and I just want to shrivel at the thought of telling my parents I may have to declare my major late. How do you avoid getting sucked into the pits of despair at self-inflicted setbacks?

I have never been the best student ever but since I started college last semester I’ve been putting in real effort, made changes, stopped doing drugs even, learned how to study and actually did very well with only 1 B and rest A’s, something I never thought I could do. 

I somehow got accepted to a very good school that specializes in engineering, I weighed the costs and the 60k a year felt acceptable for me if I was going to get an aerospace engineering degree (very high income obviously) 

It ends up being roughly 52k a year, because I’m in the absolutely wonderful position of my parents making just enough for me to not get any more financial aid, but not enough to fully support me nor pay my tuition 

But now in second semester I’ve been doing everything, office hours, spending hours every night studying and homework, I still haven’t made any friends here except my room mate so that hasn’t been an issue. But despite all my time and focus taking notes every class, I still feel so behind, I haven’t gotten above a 60% on a single test or quiz and I feel at risk of failing if I can’t do better right now, but I don’t know what else I can do. 

On top of that, I dropped a class early in the semester, but both my advisor and the cashiers office never told me I’d still be charged for it and the new class, and it wouldn’t even be covered by my loans. So now I need to get 5k to pay that before I can register for next years classes. 

It all seems like so much, I’d be getting another 60 grand in debt next year to probably end up just having to retake classes unless a miracle happens and I can pull it together, but even then I feel like I’m doing everything in my ability and I can’t even grasp the entry level classes.

I expect to continue thriving as I finish out the last 2 years of coursework I need, as well. I'm currently enrolled in my hardest college class, where I have an A and a reasonable chance of holding onto that A.

Out of curiosity, I looked into the various kinds of honors my school gives for high performance. All of these, both magna/summa/cum laude type stuff and what my school calls the President's Distinguished Honors Award (basically a short list of the top students who've gone over and above the Magna Cum Laude designation), require you to maintain a certain GPA for all college work attempted. 

Because of my 2 semesters of truly appalling grades, over a decade ago, I will never be eligible for any of these awards. My maximum possible GPA is like 3.2, if I am a 4.0 student in every semester of my education. I also found out that my school does not offer academic renewal unless the failing grades would prevent a student from graduating. They're not willing to do this to boost your GPA in general.

I realize that these honors are for students who truly go above and beyond, and because of bad choices on my part years ago, I don't qualify.

I’ve been applying to internships and receiving constant auto rejections. I have to decide if I want to go to grad school soon. My mental health is shit because of all of this and some other stuff from my past. I can’t help but feel like I dug myself into a hole. ",sadboytwo

138,I hate my apartment ,4,"This past 8 months. We toured it, rent was relatively cheap for the location near campus and buses.  It was perfect. We got so much space. My apartment had SO. Many problems. Its been really affecting my mental health. We had a cockroach problem, when we first moved in a cockroach crawled out of my roommates sink. They only come from the sink. The company/leasing did a HORRIBLE job maintaining this property, the shower head was falling off, door not working and the pressure for the whole apartment was at 90 psi. Because of that we're paying triple the amount for water. Now the sewage is backing up from the sink 🤢

 I'm genuinely worried because it poses a huge health risk to us. I can't even fucking shower anymore without it spurting out from the sink and flooding the floor. everytime maintenance comes there's always a fucking new problem. First few months were fine.

 First red flag. 3 months into it my leasing agent contacts me 3 days before the renewal is due and told everyone that we have decide to renew or not in THREE FUCKING DAYS.  Not even giving us a week or two notice. I'm a junior, and I thought it was too much of a hassle to move again. My roommates opted out because they were seniors. They informed me that my rent will be raised next year. The audacity when YOU DIDN'T FUCKING MAINTAIN THIS DAMN PROPERTY. Its like this apartment was taped together with duct tape. Now I cant even back out anymore especially when I have a 6 month internship and had already signed the lease.. I'm tired. I fucking hate corporations and the University gouging the shit out of college students. 🖕",Just_AT
139,Do you just ever have that professor everyone loves but you just can’t?,101,"I have a professor this semester that everyone seems to love, where it be in class or on rate my professor, but I just can’t get behind him. I don’t think he’s a bad person or anything but his teaching style really doesn’t mesh well with me. He gave us an extremely outdated syllabus (what’s new), he at one point gave us one question quizzes before class that are either you get 100% of it right or you (like me multiple times) forget a single unit in the equation and suddenly you’re off to fail town. 

His feedback on our reports is very vague, and he goes very fast during his lectures to the point where I can’t even follow what he’s talking about half the time.

 His class is a requirement for my major, and he’s the only one who teaches the class and I’m already sure I’m not gonna pass his class so I’ll have to take him AGAIN and I just loathe his class. Everyone else enjoys his class though and give him stellar reviews so I’m just left wondering if I’m just an idiot who’s incapable of understanding a class like his. 

Maybe I just need to try harder but it feels like my grade was decided within the first 2 weeks of class and now I’m just swimming against the current. I really should have dropped his class when I had the chance.",UKCountryBall
140,Dear all current and future college students/Questbridge finalists- DO NOT make the same mistake I did.,9," When I (19M) was in high school, I was severely depressed. All my friends had left me, I was an outcast due to being bisexual in a heavily Christian, rural community, and my parents weren't good at supporting my emotional needs. I was also dealing with past trauma and I had not gotten any treatment for this stuff since my first symptoms of depression started showing up when I was 11. I felt like I was on my own for all of this, and when I started applying for college I only wanted to attend somewhere far away since I felt like running away from my life.

So color me surprised when I got accepted into the Questbridge program. I was ecstatic and even though I didn't get into any of the schools I applied to through the program, I got into an F&M in Pennsylvania whom gave me a near full ride scholarship due to my awards. I went to that college, and things were pretty good for the first two weeks. But I started to feel lonely as most of my peers came from wealthy families that couldn't relate to my struggles of being a low income, autistic student. I was also performing poorly in my classes due to bad mental health which had never happened to me before.

My psychiatric health eventually became terrible and the counseling department at my school wasn't helpful. I tried to tell them how I was feeling but they shooed me away since I ""didn't have an emergency"" despite being in a mental crisis. One thing led to another and eventually I was committed to a mental hospital, dropped out, and my parents took me home. I then had to take 3 or more hours of therapy + medication almost every single day for months.

I was at my lowest point in my life but due to connections I made at the psych ward, the many conversations I had with my parents, and the antidepressants I was taking some of the things I had been feeling before I went to college the first time started to get better. I still felt driven to be the first person in my family to go to college, so I reapplied for college. I got into Kenyon who gave me a full ride, and was waitlisted by several Questbridge partnered schools.

I feel happier than I have felt in awhile and I think I am ready to tackle more challenges head on. But if you have made it this far than my advice to you would be if you are going through mental health struggles and you decide to go forward in the Questbridge program, PLEASE consider doing a gap term or two if you feel the same way I did when I was in your shoes. Most schools will be understanding of this, and some will even keep your scholarships until you decide to go. You deserve to be in a healthy place mentally which is a top thing you should consider before attending any of these schools. Sometimes, it is even a requirement due to the strenuous workload these colleges will put upon you.

I hope this post serves as both motivation and a warning for those who have been in similar circumstances as myself. You will do good in life in or out of Questbridge, as all of us are heavily talented people who will do great things for our country. You just got to have the right headspace to do it first.

Tl;dr: Had bad mental health in high school and at college which forced me to drop out and seek therapy. Reapplied for college and got a full ride to a semi-prestigious school outside of the Questbridge program. I hope this serves as motivation for anyone stuck in similar circumstances to put their own wellbeing first.",

142,Registration Hell,14,"I’m a rising junior, which you would think would mean I’d have a fairly good chance of getting into the classes I NEED to graduate, but NOPE. 

My school is extremely small but has WAY too many students then it can handle. This means that dorm rooms designed for two people are being converted into quads, where students have to share closets and sleep practically on top of each other. With there only being one dining hall, I’ve had to sit on the floor to eat before. And guess what, they keep raising the acceptance rate each year so more and more students are accepted but nothing is done or added to accommodate all these students. 

I’m gonna be stuck living in a dorm room again next year because the housing numbers are completely random and I got stuck with a shitty one again. Nothing like living in a freshman dorm as a junior! I have to live on campus with a meal plan to keep my scholarship :(

So, leading up to registration, I met with my advisor, planned out my schedule with backups, and guess what: I DIDN’T GET INTO ANYTHING I WANTED. The class capacities are RIDICULOUS. The bio class I need has a capacity of 6 STUDENTS. THAT IS INSANE TO ME. Also, every class I need is at the SAME time and SAME days. There’s no options here because the school is so understaffed!!

Currently, I’m screwed. I’m taking as many classes as I need that are offered online over the summer. Even then I’m stuck on the waitlist because the class cap is 10, even though it’s an online class. Wtf??

I’ve done all I can. Emailed professors. Been put on waitlist. Met with 3 advisors. I’m not going to graduate on time. I HATE IT HERE!

143,I'm definitely not the first or last person to say this but I really hate how grading works.,66,"Most of the assignments that you spend the vast majority of your time and effort on generally make up maybe 10-20% of your overall grade. The stuff you stay up all day and night doing barely feels like it matters for whether or not you end up passing the class. But then that one exam that you'll spend maybe an hour on will be the determining factor in whether you pass or fail. I genuinely don't understand why it is this way. Why would they make it so that one test matters more to your overall grade than literally everything else you did during the semester combined?! It makes most of the work you do feel meaningless and really makes me feel like I'm going to have a heart attack the day I take this test because that day is literally make or break. It genuinely feels like this system was created to stress out the student as much as possible because otherwise I just don't see the logic. I always stay on top of making sure all my assignments are completed on time but it's just really frustrating and even depressing to a degree that even if I get an A on every single one of these things it literally won't matter if I bomb the exam. All that time and energy will just end up being a complete waste.

144,My ethics prof is pretty biased,52,"I'm taking a mandatory ethics class for my core, Ethics in Tech. Until now, I've gotten pretty decent grades. And then I get a C. It doesn't sound too bad, until you hear I'm aiming for law school, a super competitive field. 

This prof has told us she's literally putting the class together as she goes along, and it shows. The vast majority of the material has been about either racism or business practices, I can count on one hand how many classes were actually dedicated to technology. 

Why didn't I quit? When she talked about her politics she seemed to take a more centrist view, I thought I could trust her to be somewhat objective. This will be relevant in a bit. 

Recently we went over the military industrial complex, and the attacks in Palestine. We're asked to write a 400-500 word reflection essay, and I have the audacity to claim that the blame for the attacks should be put on the attackers and not the weapon builders (because they're going to get them one way or another). Now I support the rich being rich and the poor being poor, apparently. I also apparently don't understand ""any"" of the historical lessons she's given. And now I'm left with the lowest grade so far, and it's not like we have a lot of them to average it out. 

Really I should have realized that she was waaay too emotionally invested in it to be anything resembling objective when she cried during class showing us some of the footage of the aftermath. 

If I'd heard she wanted to quit the philosophy department next semester because ""we aren't being taught enough radical shit"" at the beginning of the class I probably would've gotten the hell out of dodge",Geekerino
145,"I am worried I won’t be able to be with my friend over the summer, and I’m not sure what to do.",8,"Hi there! I apologize in advance because I’m probably overthinking everything way too much. I (F21) am a junior in college. I am a computer science major, and I plan to go into UX/UI design. I am a bit behind as I declared late and will have to take online classes this summer in order to graduate on time. I have struggled with severe anxiety for years, and this isn’t new. I am on medication for it (only recently started), and am on a waitlist to get therapy.

I felt like providing context about me is important to get insight about the whole thing. Here’s where the issue is. I am very close with my best friend (M21). We are not a couple, but we are very close with one another and so basically everything together. People have said we (specifically me) are too dependent, and need to spend time away from each other, which stresses me out heavily because I feel compelled to listen. My best friend says I should just focus on how HE feels about the two of us, not how others feel. Last summer, we stayed on campus and roomed together. This summer, we have both looked for opportunities off campus. We have discussed places like Columbus, Atlanta, etc. I’ve applied in the same places he has but haven’t heard anything back from anywhere. He is a geoscience major and has applied to two research positions, one in washington and one in Maryland, both of which he was a finalist for. One he got selected for and another he is an alternate for and will hear back by Wednesday about.

He has a lot of experience in his major, so I’m not surprised he got these positions. I, on the other hand, due to being behind in my major, have not a lot of experience. This makes me worry that I won’t be able to live with him this summer. I should probably continue to look for internships/research experience in both Washington and Maryland, but I’m worried that I won’t hear anything back. I know it sounds stupid, but literally all I want this summer is to hang out with him. I know I will have time to get relevant experience later on, so even just a regular minimum wage job wouldn’t bother me if we could still live together. 

Here’s where it gets complicated. Multiple people in my life are telling me that I shouldn’t follow where he goes. That, instead, I should either stay at my house over the summer or find an opportunity relevant to my field that isn’t near him. Their reasoning being I spend too much time with him and need to be independent. I don’t know if this is a good idea. Staying at home wouldn’t be great because I hate being at home. My parents are great don’t get me wrong but every time i’m there we just argue constantly and I live in a rural area so there’s little to no opportunities. Finding an opportunity relevant to my interests but away from my friend would also not be great in my opinion because of how bad my anxiety tends to be. I cannot go places without someone I am comfortable with being with me. A city where I know NO ONE feels like a recipe for disaster. “Exposure” has not worked for me in the past when I have gone on weeklong trips by myself because I just end up shutting down, getting upset/irritable being without anyone I know, and immediately wanting to leave. 

I know that, eventually, I will have to get over this paralyzing anxiety. And, I’m actually a lot better than I used to be surprisingly. But I don’t think I am at a point where I will be able to just get over it yet. 

My best friend is on a spring break hiking trip right now until thursday. He says when he gets back we can talk about it and there is nothing that me worrying about it will do for right now. I know I just need to take a deep breath and trust him but it keeps bugging me. I just want to hang out with my bro for the summer, and I feel like other people in my life think it’s a bad thing. I asked an upperclassman friend of mine for advice and he said I should just ignore what people have to say and focus on what me and my friend want to do. People want me to focus on what I want and what’s best for me, but what I want is to have new experiences with my friend and slowly push myself out of my comfort zone.

I feel kind of at a loss here. With my anxiety, I tend to only be able to calm myself down if I can work out a solution. But for here, there doesn’t seem to be one (at least until he gets back in a few days). I have tried to write out my options (such as if he accepts the washington job what I’ll do, the maryland one, etc) but it just overwhelms me to the point my stomach hurts. Does anyone have some words of wisdom or at least a tidbit of guidance that’ll keep me from going bonkers the next few days?",lawfullytired

147,the way i was lied to about making friends in college..,22,"in high school, i had bi weekly therapy sessions, mostly discussing my issues with loneliness and hopes for a better future of making friends.

pre-pandemic, which was my freshman and sophomore years, i have had greater opportunities making newer friends because of new students. frankly, a lot of my good friends in high school were students i didn’t grow up with compared to the rest of the students in my class. i also remember therapy sessions before the pandemic, discussing about relationships and friendship issues, plus bullying and low self esteem since i still got bullied sophomore year.

during and after the pandemic, junior and senior year, i still attended therapy, however, my perspective changed. i loved going to school, however, being even more isolated from friends made me more depressed, the only thing keeping me going was my cashier job. even then, i was more optimistic since college was only a year away. my therapists told me how college was a better environment and how you can build life long relationships. i’ve waited to put efforts into relationships for college.

.
.
.

now i’m a sophomore in college. i will say i spent my freshman year feeling extremely isolated. me and my roommate didn’t get along freshman year. not negatively, we just never talked. i’m in marching band, plus i’m an RA now, so i feel more busier. i do have a lot more acquaintances in college, but i don’t have a genuine friend yet, not even a genuine friend group.

freshman year was overall disappointing though. i couldn’t find friends, very socially awkward, and relied on relationships since friends didn’t work out. i just wanted someone to trust and rely on, someone who could care for me and i can care for them. i just wanted a friend.

i’m in a relationship now (hopefully it lasts long) and he will be a freshman in college next year. i feel so safe knowing that he is able to be there with me, hang out with me, and accompany me. but if he were to leave, id just fall apart as i did with my freshman year relationships. i dont know what to do without having friends and without a community.

i just feel like i have been lied to. sorry if this is long, but i really need to vent about this issue. i’ve waited most of my high school years for this moment just to feel twice as miserable and insecure.",crispybutterfinger

153,First Gen? Maybe?,4,"So about a year ago, I got a text from my school’s something-or-other department saying that I was a first generation college student, which really confused me. My mom had completed some college courses and my father attended college for a whopping 8 weeks. Plus, my grandfather got his bachelors and my grandmother got her masters in education. So it made no sense at the time. 

Come to find out, the title “first gen” doesn’t include grandparents. And at the time, the definitions I found were pretty clear cut, stating that if parents of the student hadn’t completed a college degree then the student is considered first generation. At the time, I felt ok identifying as a first gen student since neither of my parents had completed any college degree. Then, my mother graduated with her associates in August (shout out to my mom 🥳). Super super proud of her for graduating, and even more proud that she’s pursuing her bachelor’s too. It’s super exciting because at this point, I’ve had my associates for a year and a half and my mother just graduated with hers. 

Now, present day, I am preparing to graduate with my bachelor’s and am applying to grad schools. I’m finding it really really difficult to navigate, more so than when I applied at my local community college or my undergrad university. Especially for the applications that ask if my parents completed any college degree. 

Technically, I think I should still qualify as a first generation student, but it also kinda feels like stolen valor I guess lol. Especially because I had a difficult time navigating all of the college application processes and difficulty assimilating into university culture and expectations. I was the first person in my immediate family (mother, father, and 2 younger siblings) to complete a college degree, but I’d like other inputs on this. 

TLDR I’m having an identity crisis and am unsure if I’m still considered a first generation student because my mother graduated & will be graduating after me",TarotTaurus

155,I can’t help but feel inferior,21,"I’m tired. I’m a third year economics major and I just don’t know what to do anymore. I started off at a 4 year university as a political science student. I got into my second-choice school, and I was totally cool with that because my first choice was a bit of a reach. I had 7 years of speech and debate experience and tons of awards from the many tournaments I was able to compete in over the years. I really wanted to be an attorney or politician or something and I honestly thought I was cut out for it. 

However, in my second year I failed a class, and it was totally my fault. I partied too hard and got lazy. At this point, this was the only class I’ve ever failed in my life and my parents completely beat me over the head for it. They were incredibly disappointed in me, and they became incredibly discouraging. I lost my scholarship because I ranked my GPA. In addition to this, they were pressuring me to switch majors over this failure AND the fact that they don’t think I’d enjoy being an attorney/law student because that’s what they do for a living and they are not satisfied with their careers. 

I was disappointed in myself too. I had been basically a straight A student all my life. This was totally new to me, and I was crushed.

Fast forward to next semester. I’m settled in a totally different program, and I even got my scholarship back thanks to Bright Futures’ generous one-time reinstatement policy. I went with supply chain management. It was something I always had a looming interest in, and I recognized the importance and demand for these professionals. I was feeling good about the future and I was ready for this fresh start. 

Over the next couple of semesters, I would start tackling the core business classes and I was doing alright. I retook the class I failed and applied for grade replacement. Generally just Cs and Bs. I was passing but nothing to write home about. It was at this point when I started to feel inferior to my peers. Because I was always in a polisci path, I never took and “advanced” math classes in high school, so I felt like I was one of the few third year students taking COLLEGE ALGEBRA. I was objectively behind compared to people who started their freshman year in business school and I beat myself up over it. 

Now, in my third year is where it really goes downhill. I was called into a meeting from an advisor from my department. They were informing me that I would be unable to continue with the supply chain management program because I wouldn’t be graduating within four years. This came as a complete shock to me, because this was not disclosed to me in the initial meeting to change my major. I already know there’s going to be somebody in the comments blaming me for not looking into the department policies, but I genuinely don't see why this wasn't disclosed to me in the first place. I was naïve and didn't know this was a thing in college. I always thought that this was different from high school in the sense that there was no time limit, and you can take as much time as you need so long as your willing to keep paying tuition. 

So despite the fact that my GPA was WELL above the business school's requirement and despite the fact that it was still technically possible to pass by Spring 2025, they booted me out of the program that I grew to love. They told me to study economics and try to go for a masters in supply chain (lol) 

I'm still working towards a business degree. I'm still knocking out those core classes, but I'm struggling. My GPA now sits at a 2.56, and I want to transfer to another supply chain program at another institution but I really don't see what kind of business school would want a third year student who's just now taking managerial accounting, especially with a GPA like THAT. I really don't want to give up on supply chain. I'll go out of state or even international for this. Despite everything I got an EXCELLENT internship at a global tech company. Its a great opportunity and I'm very proud of myself, but I also feel like its the only thing I've got going for me. 

Half of me wants to keep telling myself to keep pushing forward, and to keep studying supply chain management. That part of me is willing to go out of state or even international for this subject. The other half thinks that maybe my old advisor was right and that I should just stick to economics and do a masters in supply chain management. 

Money is not an issue here for me. After all, my parents are attorneys so they make a great living. I'm very fortunate financially but I still can't help but feel unwanted by everybody. I'm so lost and I'm just unhappy with everything in life right now. Its all just so uncertain and I don't know how to continue. At least my parents have come around to understand my struggles and I now have their full support for what I want to pursue. 

Should I consider community college? 

TL:DR - I switched out of a major I was passionate about in my second year. The advisors for my new major did not tell me I still had to graduate within 4 years despite the switch. I got kicked out of that new major even though I was really enjoying what it had to offer as a result. I now want to transfer to another institution but I have a 2.56 GPA and believe that no school will accept someone like me (bad GPA and behind on course work.) The only thing I have going for me is a great internship opportunity in my desired field and the financial and emotional support of my family. My quality of life is poor in general and I am extremely unhappy with my situation because I feel like I simply am not being allowed to pursue what I want.",No-Ice-2269

My classmates aren't helping, and I think that being a commute is draining me pretty fast (I'm trying to move closer to university, but I can only do it in my second year)

In my first semester, my grades weren't the best and this made me question if I was in the right place. The second semester tests are getting closer and I'm freaking out because I don't think I can pass them. Starting over isn't an option because I've wasted so much money already.

TL;DR: I'm an English Major who feels demotivated by my bad grades and things aren't helping.",archangelcxstiel
157,My chill is fake,129,"This week's going to be absolute hell for me. I've got a shit ton of quizzes and assignments due and I can't even keep count of them. On top of this midterms are starting soon and I'm in deep shit because no amount of studying is ever going to be enough. 

And I had to quit my job at the game store last week to focus on school full time. I feel miserable because Ive met some of the best people in my life there and I cannot be in contact with them as much anymore. 

I've been shutting people out and this has resulted in a lot of arguments, and I hate myself so much, and everything is too much.

158,How do I get established?,2,"I'm just so frustrated with everything right now, lol.

Like, Class takes everything out of me quite literally just to do well in it, I'm either working or falling asleep and feeling bad about it, I should be working right now. At this start of this I found the classes interesting and I believed there was a way to succeed in my major, but right now it just feels impossible. I don't have the relevant experience I needed to get accepted to any relevant labs or jobs and I suppose I'm just wondering how people start from nothing? It seems like someone somewhere has to take a chance on a person with no experience, and that hasn't happened for me.

I'm planning to send out a bunch of emails and try everything again, but I'm just completely over college at the moment. Like I'm having to take gened that I'm not good at and it's taking up all my bandwith just to survive those classes, and yet people are still expecting me to have time to find a job and find a lab to be in? I don't know. I'm tired of working all day just to be told that I'm not doing enough and I'm just lazy and exagerating. Most of these remarks are coming from family, of course. They seem to have had everything handed to them on a silver platter. When did the onus for getting the experiences that quite literally form an essential part of a college major go from the school to the student? Like, I need to find a lab that will accept me in order to do a senior thesis and graduate. What?

I just don't understand how I can do everything. It's the most crushing feeling you know? Knowing I could be outside, or reading a book, or doing something that I actually care about but instead I'm here because I chose a work heavy college with professional goals while everyone else I know barely goes to class.

Do you guys have any tips for interviewing, or for getting that initial experience? I understand some part of it comes from experiences in HS that I had no control over (given that my parents sent me to a small private school with very little resources or ECs rather than a well-funded public school), but is there anything else I can do to make myself stand out? I've been doing my best to form connections with profs and grad students but.. I don't know lol.

I just hope this all works out somehow, you know? Like, imposter syndrome but right now it feels like I'm nowhere near the level of everyone else here. And they all seem to have continous freetime all the time.  I just want to get to that place where I have a lab and a decent job sorted out and I can just focus on actually doing the work instead of having all this anxiety? 

Idk. College is crap. Having pressure from everyone is crap. I'm taking shit from my own flipping parents right now for not applying to something that was completely impractical and that I had no chance with despite taking 18 credits, clubs, and everything else. Why does it always have to be like, mroe and more? Why can't we just settle that there's a maximum point at some point, lol.

161,I gave up on making friends at university and don't feel bad about it.,86,"So, this is less a rant and more a thought, but I don't really think I'm going to make any close friends at university, and you know what? That's okay. 

For some context, I live on campus, I participate in every social activity I can, and I really tried hard to connect with people. Although I'm an out of state student who doesn't know anyone at a tiny liberal arts college, I've tried hard to be as personable and kind as can be. I even started a club (that doesn't have great attendance) and applied to be an RA. 

Ultimately, I don't really have a close friend group, but... I don't know if I need one at university. I don't really think that's something I really need at university. It kind of sucks because all my close friends and family worth talking to are in NY, but I still have a pretty decent experience overall. I still enjoy what I study, I still get to goof off on occasion, I still have supportive relationships with some faculty members and staff. I even made friends off-campus through a Warhammer club.

So maybe college friend groups aren't all they're cracked up to be, but that's okay. ",Hidobot
162,I'm so exhausted (long rant),8,"I am currently in my last semester of college.  Right now, I student teach 9th grade full-time, which can be difficult on its own.  I lesson plan, grade, take care of classroom management, all of the typical teacher duties.  In addition to this, I also have to complete the edTPA, which is an extremely long and tedious exam to get my teaching license.  For those who don't know what is in the exam, I have to submit videos of me teaching, lesson plans, planning and instruction commentary (basically I have to explain why I plan and execute my lessons the way I do, both of which have to be 6-10 pages), student work samples with feedback, and more.  It's a ridiculously annoying exam that I wish I didn't have to do, but my university requires it for me to graduate.  I also have to apply for teaching jobs.  I'm terrified that I won't find a full-time job for next year.  I know that subbing isn't the end of the world, but still.

Somehow, that's not even the worst part of it.  My university is apparently god-awful at creating master schedules and in Fall 2023, they scheduled the required capstone class at the same time as an education class required to graduate.  The thing with this education class is that it is only offered in the fall and you can only take it in your senior year during your practicum (semester before student teaching), so I couldn't have taken it earlier.  For years, they always offered this education class on Monday evenings at the exact same time.  They have also generally had the capstone class (which you typically take in your last semester) held in the middle of the day for YEARS.  However, the people in charge of making the master schedule moved the capstone class to Monday evening for Fall 2023 to ""accommodate student teachers"" as you are typically not allowed to take your capstone while you student teach because it's way too heavy of a workload.  So have it in the evening when they're done teaching, right?  

Except they didn't think to consult the College of Education on this decision and the two classes overlapped.  When they released the master schedule in FEBRUARY OF 2023, I saw how those two classes overlapped and thought they would fix it.  I even emailed the scheduling people about it and they said they could not change it (even though they had MONTHS to switch it around).  When I asked about how this would impact my graduation, they said that I would either have to write a petition to the university to take the capstone class during my student teaching semester or I would have to take an extra semester to graduate so I could take that class.  This scheduling issue impacted SEVERAL of my other classmates as well.  Some opted to take the extra semester, but I was not about to take a whole extra semester FOR ONE CLASS.  So I ended up writing a petition to the university to take the class during my student teaching.  They allowed me to do it.

It's been hell.  I always have something I need to do. I can never just breathe.  I'm spread so thin right now and my mental health has plummeted.  I've told my capstone professor that I am overwhelmed and all they told me was that ""you'll be fine"".  I met with a couple of academic advisors this past week to talk about some other stuff and I brought this issue up.  All either of them were able to say was that it was ""definitely not ideal"" and I should ""consider some counseling"" (I already go to therapy, so that's taken care of lol).  One of the advisors even told me that I could always consider withdrawing from my capstone and take it next semester.  I know they probably weren't trying to be demeaning when they said that, but it certainly felt that way.  I have maintained a very high GPA throughout college.  I've worked as a tutor while going to school.  I literally got nominated for my college's VALEDICTORIAN.  I know how to work my ass off and I'm just so tired of being told that I can't do it.  I am not going to withdraw from this damn class.  However, that doesn't mean that I'm not incredibly exhausted and pissed.  I can't wait for the university's exit interview because I'm about to give them a scathing review for what they put me through.

tl;dr My university messed up the scheduling and I have to write a 20-25 page thesis while student teaching, completing a very long teaching licensure exam, and applying for jobs.  I'm just tired.",dandelioncommittee

there’s a lot of habits of hers I don’t necessarily like which I’ve pointed out kindly to her:

• using my dishes and not washing them FOR MONTHS

• leaving trash in bathroom then blaming it on me

• putting/leaving her stuff on my side of the sink

• not contributing to cleaning/leaving her stuff in common space and later asking me to clean it up when her s/o was coming over

• taking my food without asking and wasting that food

• we have a fridge we share that she brought and she left her spoiled food there for months. it’s her fridge but ATLEAST give a little bit of room 

• has two of my phone chargers which she still hasn’t returned and hasn’t mentioned on returning them

• has worn my shoes without asking once

• lashing out on me when our mutual friends mentioned that she’s owes us stuff and money. I didn’t even tell her that she should give me my money bc I understand she’s had a rough school year

• and the rude attitude and language she uses towards me (idk I feel judged half the time but I don’t say anything)

I noticed that she often procrastinates on studying and waits until the last week to study where she crams as hard as possible. This resulted in A's and B's.  Mostly A's.

I tell her that's quite a talent because most people can't do that. We would have 3 full weeks of her not knowing what's going on in the lectures. But her cramming helps a lot.

In the meanwhile, I don't think I am studying effectively because even when I study for those 4 weeks, I still fail. Like D's and F's. It makes me horrible.

And she knows it. Yet, she always tells me and boast about how she thought she was gonna fail but she would get full marks on quizzes, and would get around 90% on the exams.

I tell her that I wish I was lucky like her to be so academically smart. Because, I'm surprised I am keeping up this far but it's because I am forcing myself to work hard but it does demotivate me knowing that I won't be able to get marks like her. All I want is a C. I am happy with a C.

But sometimes I can't handle her bragging even if it's humble bragging.

Edit: As I was trying to study for my exam, I suddenly remembered that not only does she brag about her test score. She always ask about my exam score. And she knows that I always get a lowered score than her and when I tell her, she gets super shocked and surprised. Then she giggles, and now I lie about my test scores. When I tell her I got a C or something, she just goes, “oh.” Then leaves me alone. But then I remembered you guys and now I feel better when I remember the shit she pulls 😭",Busy_Needleworker_29

Every time I mention something I want to do for fun, my dad reminds me that ""no, the next three years are important!"" I applied for so many internships, but in the field I'm studying, it's nearly impossible to get an internship until junior or senior year. Most places will not take applications from freshmen or sophomores. Really compounded the bitterness when my parents were talking with my younger brother about the trip they're taking over the summer... a trip that I was not invited to. 

I don't know. I am totally aware that things will, do, and did change after starting college, but it hurts. My family is extremely tight knit, so being left out of planning a trip- hell, being left out of a trip in general- is really painful. I'm expected to get a job and take summer classes, which I agree with, but the importance that they are putting on it (over decompressing from a difficult degree plan and potentially being able to do something fun) feels pretty shitty. 

Maybe this is just normal whining, and I'm overreacting to things that are supposed to be normal. But quite honestly, it sucks. I understand that I'm an adult now, and that I need to get my shit together now. But it's starting to grate on me, even if this ""doing school over summer"" expectation has been present since I was in elementary school.

168,Can't decide,6,"I hope this belongs here, i can't decide about college, don't have anyone to talk to and i'm just so exhausted.

I applied to two different majors on two different schools and I can't even sleep knowing I'll have to decide at some point.

I applied to the best uni in my country and one of the best universities in a neighbouring country. Despite that the foreign uni is a lot more prestigious as my country has worse schools in general. Our teachers tell us to get out of the country to study, if we have the chance to do so.

I didn't really expect to get to the schools. I just wanted to see if i'll get lucky and i was supposed to apply to one more ""easy to get in"" school. 

Yesterday I found out I got into the foreign university and knowing how I did at the admission tests on the other school - I'll probably get in there too. 

The first school I applied to was my priority school. It's a major in psychology. I'm really passionate about psychology, I've been learning things about psychology on my own since I was in elementary schools. It's so insanely interesting to me but so is for 90% of the population. If I were to major in it I'd have to study for years til I'd get an okay paying job. I'm also not sure if i even want to be a psychology, I would rather work in research but that is probably not realistic in my country.

I also studied so much for the admission tests. I have adhd and the time i put into it would be insane even for a nerutypical. I was so determined.

Also my gf lives in the city but she said to not decide based on that fact + we came to the conclusion we would see each other even more often than now even if I studied abroad - something to consider but not a deciding factor.

It was my no. 1 school til I found out I got accepted to the other one and started to actually think about it more deeply.

Then there's the other school - major in business management. I'm already majoring in business (school system works a bit different here). I kind of like it, I really like marketing and other subjects are okay for me to study but it is not a passion for me. It's just semi-interesting most of the time. The school is really prestigious, one of the best ones around here (including both countries). The fact that i could get in is insane. The pay would be really great too after graduating. The city is amazing, it's a ""student city"".

I don't know what to choose. I'm scared I will regret it if I don't follow my passion but studying abroad opens so many doors, I would regret not going abroad too. The only negative aspect about studying abroad is that compared to psychology i'm just not THAT passionate about bussiness. I was also thinking about studying psych maybe later in life if i realize it really is that important to me?

It's a rant but any input would be really really appreciated. I don't have anyone to talk to about this more deeply, my parents tell me it's my choice but to be fair everyone EVEN my psychiatrist told me to rather study business (not because of my mental state, because of lack of competency psychologists tend to have). It's eating me up, i'm so tired. I wish there was some sort of magic crystal ball that would help me decide.",pusseestankcandle
169,Advice for handling the pressure and stress?,11,"Hello! This is my first time posting here, and I would appreciate some kindness and grace. I realize that life is challenging for everyone for various reasons and that my problems may seem small in the grand scheme of things, but it has genuinely been tough for me.

College has not been going terribly, but this semester has been very overwhelming. I attend a pretty competitive university, and the workload for my classes has been pretty heavy (programming systems, linear algebra, and three other courses). For CS and math, weekly programming assignments and problem sets are expected to take \~10-15 hours each, if not longer, and they are not easy.

I also have a few health conditions (mental and physical) that require 3+ weekly appointments to manage, and I get overwhelmed easily. I enjoy learning, but the pressure of grades and deadlines is really tiring, and I have not been sleeping too well. This week is Spring Break, and I was surprised by how exhausted I was after midterms and the number of naps I needed to feel better rested. Beyond that, I just feel sick (nauseous, stomach pain, etc.) from the ongoing stress.

It is frustrating that some of my professors design assignments so that I would essentially be behind if I do not work over break because of how lengthy they are. Linear algebra is not going well either (and it is proof-based, which makes everything more difficult): the material is challenging, and multiple peers have commented on it being poorly taught. I reached out to the lead instructor to share my struggles and ask for advice, but he has not responded in over one week and has instead posted a new problem set covering new material. Sometimes I think that if he has the time to do that, he should have the time to at least acknowledge receipt of my email (which I followed up on as well).

Life is not easy, and I understand that--there will be expectations and deadlines wherever I go. However, I am frustrated and tired of feeling ashamed of not being ""productive"" enough or ""having fun"" because I could be spending the time studying more, finishing work ahead of time, etc., but I am honestly so tired of how suffocating it all feels.

I apologize if it sounds like I am whining because many people have much heavier burdens (finances, war, grief, etc.) that make me realize how humans have made their own lives so tiring from all these artificial standards... but unfortunately they exist. I want to cry.

173,I hate how transactional college relationships can be,894,"I thought it was just me and the fact that I commute that made it hard to make friends, but I’m realizing now that it may not just be me. I overheard someone in the library say “UGH! I can’t stand this bitch, but SOMEONE needs to get me into parties so she-“ (the rest was unintelligible but you get the point) 

I feel like every friend I had so far only lasted a semester. And we weren’t really friends, just study buddies. Bc once the class was over. The other person would never make an attempt to reach out for anything. I would to check in on them, got short responses, but any conversation we had relied on me starting it first. And I know it’s not only me with this problem. 

If people do reach out to me, it’s for notes or they want a ride. I do set boundaries, and I feel like this bothers some people. Need notes because you were out sick? Sure. But I can’t give you all my notes after every class because you didn’t want to pay attention. Once the boundaries are up, they stop reaching out. Which kind of saddens me. I fear my personality is so shitty that the only value people see in me is service. I’m not saying transactional relationships are bad or wrong, and I know that relationships are built on give and take, it’s just that I wish that I wasn’t thrown away once I can’t provide services anymore. Especially since I wouldn’t do that to anyone. 

Honestly I’d be more accepting of the transactional relationship if all the people I ran into actually gave when they took. They don’t.

178,Weed Out Classes Suck...,259,"As the title says I am just tired of classes that are needlessly more difficult just for the sake of getting people to fail. I am in a class called ""Circuits"" and I know that is most likely just the basic class and that it'll get harder down the line, but I'd much rather at least be taught in a more understanding way. It's my first time in this course, but many people are there their 2nd or 3rd time. During lectures, my professor sometimes says this: ""Do you guys understand?"" This is always followed by silence and her just being like ""Oh well, do the homework."" Like ma'am, I'm sorry, but how does doing the homework help if the homework is way more difficult than what you covered in class? And I could barely understand that!

What's even worse is the exams are practically pass or fail. They are worth 80% of our overall grade, meaning if you fail one exam, you fail the whole course. I called off work and any plans for the ENTIRE spring break to study and it still is barely clicking. I've been watching the Organic Chemistry Tutor and every time I feel like I'm understanding, I take a look at the homework that my professor gave out and realize that I don't understand at all. The actual work is vastly different to what you would do in reality. Even my professor says you won't really have to use this extent of knowledge later on.

When the passing average of a class overall is 40% between several semesters, you KNOW something is wrong. I am slowly losing my mind. I have been studying and cramming and staying up late. I already got a 48% on my first exam (but I have one retake). If I fail another exam, I am better off dropping the class, but none of it is clicking at all. Does anyone have anything, ANY advice to study better. I have a little under a week until my second exam and I really don't think I will pass. I have watched videos, used Chegg, went to tutoring, and everything. Working on actual circuit boards is less confusing than the actual math behind it.

We have to install a browser that shouldn’t even be legal to force us to use. Being recorded while taking a test just adds unnecessary stress. Either show up and do your job or trust us enough to take the test at home without being spied on. 

I just had to take my first test and midway through my roommate comes home and starts playing South Park loudly on the tv right outside my door.  I couldn’t get up because if I moved it sends an alert to my professor that I left the room and then it’s up to him to believe me that I was telling my roomate to turn off the tv and not looking up answers to the test which is a risk that I can’t take cuz if I get a 0 on this test then there’s no way to dig myself out of it.

180,Why would making things harder make us understand it better??? ,55,"A group of my friends and I were working on a physics assignment yesterday that has easily taken each of us over 10 hours individually and we were talking to our instructor about some of the problems we were stuck on and first he just says “oh you know how to do those. Those one are easy” like??? Yeah of course they’re easy for you you already have a phd in this. Someone said that we’ve all been really struggling to grasp the concepts and he says “well I guess I need to make the homework harder then” I just don’t understand… we’re already struggling so much with the “easier” one to get the basics why would making it harder help. 

Like you’re holding a ladder off a roof for us to climb and we can barely reach the first rung and you say you seem to be having a hard time getting up here so I’m going to pull the ladder up higher.  I already didn’t like physics and this is definitely not helping ",Lbrint
181,"""should've planned ahead""",445,"Wasn't able to turn in an assignment. Really peeved about it. I have a little baby at home, husband is on leave to take care of her meanwhile I'm able to attend school.

So I had a busy day of meetings/ classes planned. I woke up early to knock out this assignment. As I'm getting up husband comes to me and says I need to take him to the hospital- he's been awake all night sick so I could sleep.

I drive him out, takes all of my morning. Come home, now I have to take care of the baby while he sleeps, she is very needy (as she is a baby lol) and I can't do anything while taking care of her.

Now I'm leaving for school- it's the whole day of classes/ meetings. Awesome. I also have a BIG test tomorrow I need to study for. 

I come home, husband is feeling better now and it's homework time. Missing that whole morning screwed me, as I was going to turn it on right along the cutoff. I missed it- 11:59. Message her, only to be told she doesn't take any late assignments in the afternoon the following day, and that I should have planned ahead.

It just sucks- idk how to plan ahead of my husband suddenly getting sick. Sure, maybe I should have every assignment for every class completed days prior to prepare for taking care of my family. My bad. 

Sure, I shouldn't have late work. But just dock me instead of completely rejecting my efforts.

This is just a vent because I'm upset. I'm not planning on turning in more late work, and I'll knock out the rest of the class and not take her again. The prof is known for being a hard ass on grades and such, but I thought that wasn't too bad. This paired with no care of what students are going through are not someone I want to deal with

ETA: I appreciate the responses I've received! I thought my time management was fine, since I scheduled time for assignments. It could be better to account for emergencies. Moving forward I'm planning on pretending things are due a day earlier to give myself a buffer if I run into a situation like this again. My overall grade should be fine if I don't repeat this.

It's not a grind everyone wants to or needs to do but because I need to do well this time, I get up at 6AM, and it's pretty much nothing but lectures, tutorials, study, work on assignments, done somewhere between 6 and 10PM.

We are 3 weeks in. I just did a test with some paracetomol and scored 4.5/5% for the grade. That's 14.5/15 in the bag. I missed one question. It's not the flu's fault, it's that I didn't read the rest of the answers like I should have. But I feel awful that I just missed out on...half a percent of my grade. It's not a big deal, I know! Feels like it though.

Everything hurts. My muscles ache, my skin is sensitive, I'm cold and my hands are getting pins and needles. My throat hurts. I sneeze. I cough.
You know. Just a lot of classic fresher's flu shenanigans.

I'm kind of scared that I'm going to fall behind. I need a poster done tomorrow - and before you say I should have done it earlier - I did! They changed the instructions the day before the due date due to a clash that was their fault. I had to prioritize after realizing I can't spend another chunk of time not working on my other papers to meet a really short deadline.

There's already another clash that paper has made again just the other day. It's the same degree. They just don't talk to each other.

I'm trying this time. I'm trying so hard. I feel like they're directly making it hard for us. If things were just as sheduled, and they didn't whip out all these last-minute arrangements, I would feel better. But I can't change it.

Before we took the test, my peers and I were talking about people we knew who took his course the year before. One of his classes didn't get above a D in his 2nd exam. The class got curved, but definitely set the standard/ vibe before the exam began.

Apparently I'm the fastest person to complete one of his exams. And he's the only professor who teaches this class. Like, bro don't tell me that. I'm now terrified.

188,The graduate school system in the US is broken,0,"So you may look at this as “He JuSt WaNtS a FrEe DeGrEe!” And if you do then fuck off.

In the sciences, the only thing that actually matters in the end is the research and schools need to realize this. I’m a much better researcher than I am a student which is visible in the fact that my Master’s research was great but I barely got through classes. Now I’m in my PhD and may have to drop before I even get to the research part. I’m failing a class where at most 1% of the material is relevant to my specific field. I’m going to lose my scholarship because my GPA will fall below a 3.0 and I can’t afford the tuition or the cost of living in my area without it.

In said class, I feel like I’m studying more for the test and not learning the material at all. The professor isn’t good and the textbook sucks. A different class I’m taking heavily involves what I need for research and has a key difference: there are no tests in the class. I find myself learning more without tests because it’s much less stressful. The homework assignments are tough but I learn as I do them and from the lectures. My advisor in my Master’s had this same philosophy “how much you can remember in an hour and 15 minutes doesn’t accurately show how much you know as a grad student.”

I’m not saying to get rid of classes entirely but I think we need to realize that tests are kind of bullshit in grad school. Let the research show how knowledgeable you are. Instead you’ll have people like me who flunk out and never get to show how much they actually know because we aren’t good test takers.",AstroNerd92

We don’t even know her since this class is 100% online and there are no face to face meetings. They are only worth 10 points each and it’s not a big part of our grade but I didn’t check out the posts because we aren’t required to respond to each other if we don’t want to. It was only because we have a GroupMe chat that someone was able to find out she was cheating and that she had done it twice before. It looks like she didn’t copy me but the girl she copied isn’t in the group chat. Now I’m just super pissed and super worried because she might copy off me next since all she did was leave the group chat but not drop the class after everyone caught her in the act. We have a few discussion boards left and I definitely do not want this happening again. I also do tend to write a lot during discussion boards as I love to write a lot and I am worried that she may copy me next seeing I have a lot to say over the prompt and discussions.

190,Feeling a bit screwed over by my advisor,22,"So I’ll start by saying this is my fault, I shouldn’t have blindly followed what my advisor said for what classes to take, but I did and here we are. 

I’m in my second semester of community college, with plans to transfer to a university after two years. Turns out some of the classes my advisor had me enroll in only counted towards one goal area of the transfer curriculum, when I should’ve been taking classes that count towards two. So now I have 3 classes that I took that were half wasted, and I have to take 4 more Gen. Eds to get back on track.

This wouldn’t be a huge problem but my schedule is already packed with classes for my degree. I’m in Engineering so it’s a pretty heavy course load. I’m going to have to take 3 or 4 classes this summer, which includes calculus and chem2. 5 or 6 classes in spring and 6 classes in fall. I’ll still have a couple classes to finish my last summer as I’m trying to transfer. 

I’m already stressed just looking at my plan. Also super frustrated because I’m in only 12 credits this semester. When selecting classes with my advisor, I asked if I should be taking one more, and he strongly advised me that, no I should not. This semester has been so easy that I very well could’ve taken chemistry or something which would’ve helped significantly. 

To add, I’m 28. I don’t have an extra year to waste by taking an extra semester and delaying my transfer. I also need to maintain my 4.0 because I plan to apply to Georgia Tech (I know chances of getting in are slim but I still want to try). I also have to work at least a couple days a week. I have bad mental health, which is the main reason I haven’t started college until now, and I’m starting to spiral into anxiety and doom. I know I’ll get through this but I just had to rant…

UPDATE: One of the classes my advisor suggested I take next spring or summer is only offered in the fall. I won’t have the prerequisites completed to take it this fall. Looks like I’m taking a third year… I feel so defeated. ",OkIntroduction7560

193,I wish I could enjoy my senior year,41,"College for me has been fucking rough. Graduated high school during the pandemic and my entire first year and a half was online. I studied a major (linguistics) that I really enjoyed but i finished the core classes early in my  first semester during my junior year so I would only need to take general Ed classes my last year and a half to earn enough units/credits to finish my degree. This is when shit started going downhill. 

I completely lost my passion for school. I couldn’t get myself to go to class, pay attention, or turn in my assignments. I felt like school had taken my passion for learning and turned it into an 11:59 pm turn in date every week. I couldn’t understand what was going wrong because I used to love learning and doing well in school. I had talked to some of my professors and they were very understanding so thanks to their support I was able to turn in my necessary assignments and finish my junior year. 

During the summer I felt like I could be my self again. I started taking up my old hobbies and interests to where I started to feel great again. I knew that this is what my college experience should be like for a little while until I could figure out how to finish my degree so I went to my schools enrollment services to request a gap semester so I could continue to work in my mental health. To my shock they denied my request.

They told me because I only had my senior year left that I had to finish my degree. I asked if there was anything I could do to just take a semester off because I wanted to finish school but I needed a semester to find my passion again. They basically told me that it’s either I finish it now, or I could just not show up next semester but I would fail my classes for not showing up and lose my financial aid and have to pay for my tuition on my own. So I decided to suck it up and after all it was just two more semesters right?

This has been the worst time I’ve ever had in college. I hate going to school. When I see that my assignments are due I don’t get that “oh crap” feeling to do them last minute anymore. My GPA has tanked bad. I’ve missed most of my classes and missed tests and a lot of my education. I feel like I’ve missed the learning part of my education and I’m only doing the stupid assignments. 

I barely passed last semester, but it sucks that what I had imagined to be my senior year with chill classes (and they are, they just aren’t attention-grabbing enough for me to do them anymore) is gone. I want that younger version of me in college that would learn material outside of class, that would go to office hours to learn more, the one who still wanted this degree. I feel like college has robbed me from my desire to learn all for some shitty required classes and more money in their pocket, while I force myself to do the work in order to not go into debt for a degree.

TLDR; Admissions denied my request for a gap semester because it would mess up their graduation numbers and I’m paying for school with my mental health.",Charming_Visual_8301

I should’ve squashed this after the first week because I understand how codependency works, I have severe BPD so i understand. It didn’t bother me the first two weeks because I saw how happy being around him had made her but now every time i’m in my dorm i’m severely overstimulated by him and now i just feel bitchy, even though i don’t show it. Her bf snores VERY LOUDLY, like a grandpa, so I have to wear headphones to sleep every night and now it hurts my ears and my sleep schedule. I can’t even change in my own room without going to the bathroom or having to ask him to close his eyes. i can’t even do homework in my dorm bc of how loudly they talk and how LOUD the kissing is. it’s affecting my entire life.

I don’t care about how much they kiss, it’s just the sounds that overstimulate the hell out of me!!! one night my boyfriend spent the night and he’s a very heavy sleeper and even he woke up from the sounds of them making out and doing… other things… and now he doesn’t want to come over because it makes him uncomfortable. 

She never goes to his dorm because he lives in a loft and he knows he can’t get away with being this intimate in front of his other roommate. 

we’ve also discussed me getting a cat for my panic disorder that causes me to faint and have panic attacks, and she was 100% down until the bf said he had an allergy and now she’s like “well… maybe you should wait.. i’m feeling indifferent about this now” 

The reason why I haven’t said anything in so long is because she’s just so kind and nice and she helps me out with so many things because i’ve been dealing with depression and major health issues so i just feel like a dick, and i don’t want her to feel like she can’t relax with him around me, BUT ITS JUST THE DAMN KISSING AND SEXUAL NOISES!!!!!! The idea of talking about this to her makes me extremely uncomfortable because i feel like i’m putting her in a hard spot, she needs to be around him 24/7 and i just can’t deal with it anymore. i’m thinking of moving into a single but she’d be so sad, and it would make me very sad because i used to love being around her when we had our own time. she used to always preach hanging out with girls and how it recharges femininity and is better for women but now he’s always around and i feel so much sadness and i feel even more alone because my best friend is always with this guy and i never get to talk to her. i feel like i’m living alone atp. 

i also just miss spending time with her and feeling like i had my best friend to hang with instead of always having to be around him, they go everywhere together now and i can’t get alone time with my friend. don’t get me wrong, he’s cool asf and i used to like being around him but this whole situation is making me resent both of them now. Am I a dick for not saying anything?

203,I signed up for Intro to kinesiology but I feel like I'm in Intro to Physical Education,6,"I'm taking kinesiology at my local community college as a pre requ to get into undergrad for DPT. Everything that I have don this semester feels very physical education focused. I know that kinesiology coveres the world of excersize science and thus, also incorperates those looking to get into physical education. I dont know if its because our teacher is a coach at the school, but f\*ck me! Every single assignment is about sports. Im half way through the semester and we have yet to talk about how the human body moves at all! 

Its all, whos your favorite athetle and why, Talk about ethics around sports, explain how sports mascots can be an issue. 

This class feels like a collasal waste of my time and money. In addition the teachers grading technique is so confusing beacuse he assignes 3 assignments but we only have to do one, So grades are often not correct in canvas beacuse they get marked as missing. 

Im sure Im not the only one in this boat, and he is definiatly not the only assanie teacher out there uUt omg am Im loosing it in this class! And I just need to get it off my chest!!!

204,I'm honestly so sick of this place,15,Ngl I'm starting to feel extreme burn out when it comes to school and it's causing me to be less and less motivated for my classes. I never went through this before and have always been someone that stayed on top of my work but recently with the mountain of homework I get from most of my classes and me struggling trying to maintain even a low B in my classes is becoming too much. I have literally no time to myself anymore as every waking moment that I'm not in class is spent doing assignments and the fact that I have literal back to back exams until the end of my semester isn't helping. Everytime I'm on campus I feel like I can't breathe and I end up on the verge of tears. I keep telling myself to just take it one day at a time but it honestly feels like it's never going to end. Even the classes I was once enjoying I'm starting to hate bc its associated with my school in general. I'm going to counseling to try and help with some of this but honestly I'm just so over everything. I'm sorry for this wall of text but I really just needed to get it all off my chest. Has anyone else felt with this?? I know that I'm definitely not the first person to feel this way and I won't be the last but sometimes it honestly does feel that way.,fugly_raccoon

206,My regret of dropping out/being a creative Rant,0,"Long story short, I went to film school. I dropped out during lockdowns because I was doing really well in the field already. The degree doesn't really help either way unless you want to teach film or video. 

That was about 4 years ago, I still don't really need to go back but I keep feeling this need to finish. Also having struggles with my choice of field. I knew from 11 I wanted to work with cameras in some way, by age 15 I knew I wanted to be a filmmaker, by age 20 I realized how hard that actually is. I feel blessed to know what I wanted to do so early.

But sometimes I wish I was a little more boring and just went into STEM. Money can be made in video, I do wedding and can easily start making $80k-$125k in weddings. But sometimes I wish I just went into computers, got the degree, made make a good salary, buy a nice car, go on vacations, have a family, simple.

But instead, I have this damn God-given passion for art and creation lol. Even if I was in STEM I'd probably quit to pursue what I'm doing now anyway.

207,financial issues.,5,"I'm mostly just looking to vent here. I have looked into school programs and stuff so I am taking action.

I moved to another state by myself to attend school after saving up for 4 years. I was and am adamant about supporting myself and not getting help from my family. Before I left for school, I had a really tough time with addiction (alcohol) and it put a huge burden on my mom specifically (I don't want to go into too much detail, but it costed her money). I recently was laid off from my job and now I can barely pay my bills and have had to resort to taking help from my family.

I know there is nothing wrong with asking for help, especially from your parents but I can't help but feel guilty and just overall disappointed in myself. I know being laid off wasn't my fault, (I can't apply for unemployment I don't think, the SOB was paying me under the table) but God, I just wish I didn't need their help. I feel like a major financial burden on my family.

I have had thoughts of leaving my school and attending a community College but I know my mental health would become even worse. I left my hometown for a reason, and the idea of going back there gives me such a pit in my stomach. I have started to build a life at school, I have friends and I am getting great grades (4.0 gpa) so it's not like I'm fucking around but I still can't help but feel guilty.

I know my mom specifically struggles financially, I can't help but feel like I am dragging her down. I have been applying to jobs every single day non stop for nearly a month straight. I just don't know what else I can do to make things easier for her. Yes, my parents chose to have a kid and the economy is shit, but I will be 23 in less than 3 months and I really can't help feeling like a failure because of this.

I also have medical bills that are piling up. I found a much more affordable therapist which has helped. I live in a scummy ass studio apartment with the lowest rent I could possibly find. I take the school shuttle, go to food banks, etc. I still cannot seem to get a leg up.

209,the system for reporting teachers is abysmal,5,"TL;DR: the compensatory practices invented for helping teacher retention have morphed into practices that actively interfere with the safety of students/the student body


“well everyone has different teaching styles” “oh you just cant take it personally” 
i’ve heard these phrases about 20x the last 6 weeks ever since Week 1 of classes. My professor is evil and i mean that. he refuses to answer questions, calls us unhireable and tells us we’ll never find work, gives instructions that dont make sense and then screams (yes SCREAMS) when a mistake is consequently made. he is uninterested in the wellbeing or actual education of his students, and there are reports i’ve found since 2004 of the exact same unchanged behavior mentioning him belittling and demeaning and emotionally abusing his students. yet he remains on staff.

I know that the education system is unfair and exploitative and i understand the necessity of granting tenure/other mechanisms invented to ensure the retention of good professors. however when these mechanisms are extended to horrible teachers that is my issue. this man has been abusing his classes for at least 20 years to the knowledge of administration and he is simply allowed to continue? because of tenure? its ridiculous. it shouldnt be this hard to get physical evidence of abuse reviewed and resolved, literal hard physical evidence that i’m being told must be “corroborated” by the same students that have submitted their own separate evidence already. its ridiculous. and now my degree is contingent on this professor either magically shaping up nd being better, or my school actually stepping up and doing something about it.

I’ve been able to exercise somewhat regularly, but I end up skipping whole weeks as soon as I have an exam or essay due because I need the extra time just to do my work. I also have been trying to diet but I can’t handle the strain of eating less or giving up “feel good meals,” on top of the stress of college so I end up giving in. I can’t practice singing or playing a guitar because dorm life makes it impossible. And I can’t afford to take formal lessons because I don’t have the money to afford them. I’m just so frustrated and generally pissed off right now because I feel like I’m wasting my youth. Partying and going out with friends is fulfilling to some people, but not to me. I wanted college to be a time of self improvement and self discovery for me. Instead, it’s just been distracting from the things that are actually valuable to me.

218,I feel like I don't belong in college,44,"The impostor syndrome going hard these past few weeks... I am in my first year and studying computer science. I've been having problems with memory and focus for quite a while, and in the last year of high school, it started affecting my ability to study. It continued in college and I'm suffering greatly.

The first semester was a disaster. I've never studied more and got worse results. I failed 5 out of 6 classes (the one I passed was English). I have another chance to fix this in August so it's not like everything is lost, but that doesn't change the fact that I feel dumb and like I don't belong here. I attended classes regularly and even though I could have studied more, given the effort I put in, it's insane that I failed almost all of my classes. Now, I just don't feel like I am good enough to even be there and out of shame, I am skipping classes constantly. I am not ashamed because of other students but of myself.

I was always great and was considered one of the smartest people among my friends. But here I am, unable to even understand my professors. For some reason, I can't simultaneously write and listen to class... I either write or listen. When I write I just mechanically copy information (and we write a lot). But when I try to focus on what is being explained, I don't understand anything. It's like listening to Chinese that is spoken with an Indian accent (I don't speak either of those languages). And what's worse is that others don't seem to have these problems. They can both write and pay attention, they can talk about class and solve problems together because they understand what's going on, and they participate and answer professors' questions. I just feel dumb.

Like what am I even doing here? Sure, computer science was not my first choice so you may argue it's my lack of passion, but it's not like I hate this. Heck, I even enjoy a good portion of it and never hated math. I am mostly interested in game development, but I don't know how I'll achieve anything if things stay this way.

I feel like most of my mates have even fuller schedules and they have the strength to keep getting by, yet I'm barely able to get out of bed some days.

222,Rant: Trig professor has a god-complex and unrealistic expectations.,0,"TL;DR:

Struggling in a trig course and thought I simply sucked and needed to work harder, stay up later, drink more coffee, etc. After looking at my past successes, and reexamining the plain reality of the matter, I determined the course was created by an elitist asshole that gets off on running students into the ground under the guise of standards.

Wanted to drop early in the semester but thought I would lose full housing benefits. In reality, I may have to repay half of my housing and a portion of the class costs; this may also come out of my future housing allowance.

~~Professor~~ Asshole has complete shit all over the notion of pursuing pharmacology or synthesis chemistry.

Thoughts?

Full version:

Alright, so my trig professor has unrealistic expectation for undergraduates and isn't satisfied with work done in MML, he wants to have his own separate quizzes and tests in Ecampus where he has sole dominion over what's right and wrong. He staggers the quizzes across multiple non-consecutive chapters and generally looks down upon students. If someone comes in completely ignorant of trig and thinks this class is the place to learn, well, good luck. Were it my only class I would say it would be possible, but I also have general chemistry and an accelerated ENGL-1302. The ENGL-1302 course just finished up and I pocketed another A, but I have accelerated HIST-1302 right behind it.

At first I thought I simply overburdened myself and I just needed to shrug off the idea of having any time for myself this semester but it seems I was wrong. I move from one due date to the next because he's racing through the material like it's a a four week accelerated class. He is artificially increases the difficulty of testing by expecting work with full work shown in a graphical editor in an unrealistic amount of time. Fortunately, the quizzes aren't timed in Ecampus, unfortunately, they are ridiculously short in MML. Rather than place the unit 2 exam after spring break and allow the class to study, he crammed it in front of the spring break where my 8wk final + research paper was due.

I have no doubts that I did poorly on the unit 2 exam. Between the ridiculous workload, hopping and skipping between chapters, and absolutely absurd pacing of the class, it's all work and no study. I find myself going from deadline to deadline without ever being allowed to simply study the book and obtain a thorough understanding of the material. For the longest time I thought the problem was me and I just needed to move faster but there are only so many cups of coffee I can drink and 5AM nights I can do before it all catches. Somewhere between stringing more profanity together than I ever did in the USMC, feeling depression for the first time in my life, and the outbursts of anger, I have determined this ""professor"" is merely an asshole trying to run people into the ground.

Then again, if this class actually isn't the problem and it really is me that simply sucks, then I need to withdraw and go seek life elsewhere.

\[sarc\] I get a lot of shade thrown at me from family with the ole ""You're just lazy and won't do the work!"" line. Right. . . despite being 30+y/o, retired military (infantry), having built my own business, and having obtained (A)s in ALL my other classes except history (B), I am simply lazy bum in the one class that I'm outright failing, but not lazy in the others. The straight A student just decided to become lazy in one and only one class. There is absolutely nothing illogical at all about that notion.\[/sarc\]

I would have dropped the class within the first few weeks but I didn't know how it would affect my VA benefits. After making some calls, I think my benefits will be recalculated at 58% enrollment for Jan - now and I'll owe the difference back, along with the difference for the class cost. I'm waiting on my second exam results before I make a decision to drop the class. It's negatively impacting my other classes and this asshole has single-handedly poured the whole gas station on my old childhood hatred of formal education. Simply submitting garbage work and eating the F without reduction of my benefits is also an option. He has utterly shit all over any idea I had about becoming a pharmacist or synthesis chemist, likewise with the asinine software I have to use, even for on-campus classes. College is not worth it.

I have become absolutely jaded by what college is and have some regrets about enrolling. I'm still grappling with the sunk cost dilemma and have pretty much ruled out graduate school, preferring to finish CC with an associates and go back to my business.

Thankfully, my chem professor is the opposite and is very laid back. He provides hardcopy homework, extensive supplemental resources, flexible due dates, and allows us to spend more time studying the material and learning the concepts than just being tied up with outdated drill and kill homework methodology. Considering he is also prior military, much older and more experienced than most professors, a brilliant man with a PHD, it's understandable that he is how he is. His class is much more conducive to learning. He understands he's teaching undergraduate chemistry and not theoretical physics at MIT.

223,"I'm actually going to fail, I am not exaggerating this time",45,"Warning: I might say some things that sound disturbing or mentally unstable but that's because I am actually in shambles and distraught given that I \*just\* finished my midterms and everything that could go wrong went wrong.

Throughout almost all of college, I have been a solid A/A- student but this is where it ends for me. I'm in pretty much the second semester of my international relations degree (yes, as a third year student: weird educational context I'm not going to get into here) and I might seriously have to be concerned about academic probation or god forbid, dropping out. I think there are a few problems here: without telling every single part of the story, I'll just list out the main stuff:

1. This semester, I'm taking classes that are hard for me and that I don't really get or enjoy that much. There will always be classes like that in college, and I'm proving myself to be unable to handle them. Maybe, and this is really where I'm leaning towards right now... I'm actually too stupid/dumb/lazy/academically inept for college.
2. Loss of motivation for some reason. Could be burnout? Last semester I got away with a lot more than I thought I'd be able to, including A LOT of horrible study habits, organization, and pretty awful hiccups. I had some disaster moments/super super close calls last semester that made me think at some points that would be the semester my GPA plummets, but I somehow made it through relatively unscathed grade wise. This semester, I'm not getting away with anything: maybe the stress of having gone through that already is really taking its toll. The weird thing is that college/going to classes/doing academic work is kinda the only thing keeping me mentally afloat, I find that when I'm on break I actually get really depressed and even more unmotivated so... (I am most certainly not mentally afloat right now though due to my inability to do that academic work up to standard.) I'm even forgetting basic things like when things are due on occasion, which I don't usually have a problem with at all, ever. I'm not doing the readings (or skimming them when I do), even for classes I genuinely enjoy like International Security. I'm also handing in every paper late, whether a minute late or 5 minutes late, it's always late and never before the time of day that it's due.
3. Technology issues. I broke the screen on my laptop right before midterm week and had to get it repaired, so until the Tuesday of midterm week I only had my phone. When I got it back, I also didn't have internet at home until yesterday. I could have gone to the public library or my college's library to use a computer, but neither were within walking distance and I was unmotivated and lazy (sigh). Technology issues also got me on my online macroeconomics exam that I took earlier today. I couldn't figure out how to create a table and graph for a long while (there was only one question which required it so I wasn't well prepared), google docs didn't work THE WHOLE DAY!!!! and I was unable to actually submit a screenshot of it on the test anyway because I dragged the screenshot to the ""submit file"" portion of the exam instead of clicking on ""submit files"" and searching FOR the screenshot... which replaced the entire exam with a huge picture of the screenshot and by the time I tried to go back to it, it was closed and I couldn't send it nor could I fill in my three unanswered multiple choice questions. Google docs not working (it would never connect/load even though I had good internet generally!) also demotivated me from finishing a paper for one of my other classes because that's where I had worked on it the whole time and I was too stupidly lazy to find other technological workarounds. When setbacks like that happen, I lose motivation so fast and I am not resourceful enough :( I joked to myself the whole week that technological problems would be the reason I drop out of college
4. Other completely unrelated interests (dare I say, fixations?) my fixation on singing is deeply distracting and messing with the proper order of my priorities. At least in previous semesters, most of my fixations were somewhat related to my coursework: topics within history, political theory, music that was actually related to the music classes I was taking at the time, etc. This is just completely unacademic and distracting.

And yes, I'm already in danger of failing even not knowing my midterm grades. I have a D in my macroeconomics class (10/15 on my first test yikes!), and Bs in my myth making and intermediate micro classes... well it's a longer story, I actually failed my first micro midterm \*including the 20 point curve\* but the amount that the grade weighs on participation/attendance brings it up like 20 points from my midterm grade + curve. Also, that B in my myth making class could go down to an F given that I emailed my professor my essay (worth 20% of my grade) 10 minutes late instead of being able to submit it through the online portal, and there's a serious chance she might not accept it (strict no late work policy), in which case I'll just take the hit. I don't have a dang clue what's going on grade wise in my international security class either, but I don't suspect that's going well for me either. The only classes that aren't a total disaster for me right now are German and choir. I don't know what else to say except that it's super over for me and I'm probably just unfit for serious educational study. A shame, because I consider education a part of my civic duty/duty as a human with all the resources I have to get a good education and I know I have failed to meet acceptable standards of education in high school. I'm not meeting them right now either. Grad school is probably completely out of the question now, and I'm foolish for even having considered trying to become an academic. Idk what else to do: I'm too stupid for anything else but I'm too stupid for academia as well",giftedburnoutasian
224,I made the wrong friends in college and now it’s too late,53,"I made a lot of friends here but now that I am a few months from graduating, I realize that there’s only one person I want to keep in touch with. 

I have never had drama w friends before this year. I took a gap year during Covid and my friends didn’t, so they all graduated a year before me. Life has changed so much for them so it’s natural that our relationships have too. There was some drama that involved my best friend and I defended her, which got me into the drama. Everything I did or said was taken out of context or deemed malicious because these ppl have nothing better to do than gossip and spread rumors. In the beginning I tried defending myself but I’m just at a point now that there’s no reason to care anymore what they think. 

I’m anxious because I know a lot of them now hate me and probably talk bad about me together. I know I shouldn’t care and I don’t really since I think they’re all losers anyway. Still sucks though so I’m just venting. 

My best friend reminded me that they’re all probably just really bored since they’re lost and unemployed with mommy and daddy still paying rent a year after graduation. I’m upset though cause it seems like everyone’s mad at me and no one else even though there were so many worse ppl involved. 

I know I can’t control what they think or do but I don’t like leaving this place knowing that I’ve been misunderstood by people I used to call friends. 

Anyway, I’ll be ok. I’m moving across the country for my dream engineering job with my boyfriend of 2+ years. Best friend just recently got her dream job in another state. We are the only ones who actually studied hard and beginning our careers. These people are bored and beyond privileged so I’m glad I’m leaving them here. ",kjweeno
225,I just want to learn,50,"I am in the military I am enrolled at a military friendly school that in my eyes is really just a veteran friendly school. I was taking an online math course because I’m stationed outside of this states. First off they REQUIRE in person testing. Don’t get me wrong, I can understand why math teachers are mad these days and don’t want people to cheat. However I quite literally don’t have any testing sites near me. They told me my officers can be my proctor, but won’t allow me to do any online proctoring. The officers I work with are SAR pilots and we are understaffed. The fact that I would have to ask an officer to stop working, not take a break or take time away from being with their family is ridiculous. It’s an online class. 
The main reason I needed to rant is because I got military orders after I started my semester that would cause me to miss a test, since it landed on the same dates. I emailed the professor asap (3 weeks in advance before the test) that I would be at military training and asked if I could take the test the next day since I would be in the states and could find a testing center on a Saturday. They said “they don’t allow extensions for anyone according to policy” and that “I can miss the test and have my final exam replace that missed test grade”. First off, how does that not immediately put me at a disadvantage compared to my peers? Obviously the first test grades won’t be good, but at least you would know what to look for and do for the second test. Secondly, how is that military friendly. I was even willing to take the test early on a weekend while on orders but they shut me down after the first question. 

I escalated it up through the college, hoping to find a resolution because now I’m just confused. These tests are 45% of our grade.. and now I’m finding out that the school policies apply to everyone and that my teachers “offered me a remedy” so my problem isn’t valid. I don’t understand how what they told me was a remedy, when most colleges/classes just let me reschedule exams.

Thank you for listening to my rant, I’m just frustrated because I had no control in this situation. I am REQUIRED to go to places I have orders to, and it’s a “military friendly” school. I will add that the military side of the school has been supportive but it is GLARINGLY obvious that the college itself doesn’t have any policies or really much in place to assist their military students overseas. I also don’t understand why you wouldn’t want to help your students in situations like these. What am I going to have to do now? Email every teacher before I register for a class and ask if they’ll be able to accommodate me if I get orders? Exhausting.

EDIT: TLDR - I got orders that coincided with a test and my teachers wouldn’t help me find a solution. The school is saying that the teachers can follow their own policy’s regardless of military status. ",spoopypondo

228,Are anyone else's teachers absolutely obsessed with sources/citation to the point where it becomes the entire point of the class?,814,"Today I got handed back an assignment I worked for days on as incomplete (0 points) because some of my claims lacked citation. One of those claims was that adding water to cement makes it wet. Another claim that ""lacked citation"" was that buildings are important to humans. The assignment was to make an informative poster about concrete.

Almost every assignment I've turned in has been like this. It's not that I don't put enough citations where they're needed, I had 8 sources for less than 2 pages worth of text and referred to them constantly. I've gotten full scores on papers where I didn't understand nor care about the topic and put zero effort into writing, with the only teacher comment being ""nice use of sources!"". Seems to be literally the only thing they care about, to the point where every single class I take feels like Citations 101.

Is this normal? Are we supposed to get A's for writing a shit poster with citations spewing out of its ass and F's for well written paper where you forget to support your literal claim that water is wet?

During my freshman year one of my parents got cancer and I dropped one of my classes because my mental health was seriously terrible. I was still a full time student, but I was 2sh behind the normal 30sh for the academic year. I didn't think it was a big deal until this semester when I got an unexpected grant for being in a high demand major (which hasn't changed since I started college).  Apparently I would have qualified for it last semester, but didn't get it because I was 2sh short of the 60sh requirement. Because of this, I only get three payments instead of 4. I can't even use it to cover a summer course that I'm going to be taking soon.

I suppose I should be happy that I'm getting anything, but with dorm prices skyrocketing +$2700 a year and me paying for college by myself with no help from parents, I'm just sad that I missed out on so much.

231,I’m resentful of the idea that your major has to be your passion,420,"So many people go to college immediately after high school. And I’m not saying young adults don’t know what they’re passionate about but when you’re that young the careers/subjects you’ve been exposed to are sooo limited. 

I came into college as a digital arts major because for most of my life drawing was my passion. I did good in my art classes but the stress of being unsure of my job prospects after I graduated and wondering how I’ll pay off my student loans made me choose a more safe and profitable major. 

Once I did that I worried whether I’ll be miserable my whole life because I didn’t study my passion. But I’m loving my prerequisites and the information I’ve been learning the past few months. I’m developing a new passion in a career younger me never knew existed. ",blueivysbabyhairs

233,Ever kept something college related secret from ur parents?,13,"My life is lowkey a mess (one that I'm fixing) at the moment, because of new routines that have gotten in the way of things, but it's for the best, so that's alright... This however, has made me keep many things from my family, and one of them, is college related...

I was supposed to take a child development course for my job, however like I've said, I've just been a big mess lately.... I could totally do it if I didn't have a job too, but I do, and I couldn't take it (and I'll tell u why soon).... I think it's also my mother who has bad mental health and is always telling me very stressful things, about how much she hates her life, hates everyone, wants to commit you know what, and to hear that is just awful, and she is always venting to me, when i'm trying to study because she has no family/friends... So I have to listen, and often she is mad and has mental breakdowns, so it's all very bad...

It may have even affected my mental health but i don't pay much attention to that honestly.... Why I quit the class too, is because although it's easy by itself, I have other classes I was REALLY behind on... It's outside of my major, so I can graduate, and am planning on getting just that class and another by themselves for a certificate, and because ig I'm a perfectionist... I don't want to settle for a C....

I feel bad though because I need that for a job, they believe I'm enrolled, and so does my mom, but I'll just say I got kicked out of the class for not turning in an assignment, and enroll during the summer instead 🙃.

234,My roommate makes me feel so insecure,126,"I feel selfish for even saying this, but I truly believe my roommate is ruining my time here at college. I love it here, and I've made so many amazing friends, but something needs to change. He'll game online late into the night, and keep me awake, literally screaming to his friends on discord. I can't study or do homework in my room, because of the noise. I've asked him to please be quieter several times, but if anything he's only gotten louder. On top of this, I already have problems studying, so I'm lucky if I can go for a few hours without getting distracted or sidetracked. I came to college as an honors student, and I already had my associate degree in highschool, but now I'm failing exams, skipping class, and getting behind on everything. Most (if not all, let's be real) of this is my fault, but some of it is linked to me just not feeling comfortable in my dorm.

Not only does he always make random, loud noises while gaming (like six hours a day), but he also happens to be a perfect student. He never studies, and grasps content immediately, then pisses the rest of his time away, before getting perfect marks on exams and quizzes. We're the same major, so right now we're in some of the same classes, and he always makes a big deal of telling me his score on big assignments, before asking me how I did. I never give him actual numbers (because I don't feel comfortable doing so), and hearing about how perfect he is has become so grating. Last semester I failed a class, while he had a 99, and all he would talk about after tests was how ""fucking stupid"" someone would have to be to fail, and of course I was one of those people most of the time. It's gotten to the point that I hate seeing him, and actively hide/leave the room when I know he'll be in it.

I don't want to be honest about my issues because I know he would just tell everyone we know that I'm struggling. I can't trust him with any secrets. I haven't contacted my RA or RD about this because it's more of a mental thing instead of a physical one, so I don't know if they can really do anything about it. I just feel like crying all the time when I'm around him. I only want to be in my dorm when I'm sleeping, and this semester I've been trying to get out as much as I can. I just really could use some advice here, and I apologize if I sound like a brat for posting this

236,i fuckin hate chemistry.,28,"i am looking to pursue physics for a career but guess what, for all entrance exams in my country i need to learn chemistry too and HOLY FUCK WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SUBJECT

shd be 1<2<3<..... 18, right? maybe with the exception of 18 cuz inert gases  
NO! it goes like: 18<2<1<13<15<14<16<17 !!!!  
radius of gallium is smaller than  aluminium cuz poor shielding effect. surely, if this is the case then it should be the same for Si and Ge too, right? NOPE, LOL GET FUCKED.

so many inconsistencies like this every fuckin where man what in the actual fuck is even this thing, it's almost as if they're just making up shit for the sake of explanation rather than developing a concept that is actually consistent. like how the FUCK did multiple scientists read the damn research papers, see the amount of inconsistent exceptions and were lyk ""yup that seems fair""??!?

you know what let's just take physics for example. what happened when einstein realised newton's idea of gravity was wrong? was it:  
A. ""oh yeah, but like on a larger scale just like do <different thing> and in case of an <y event> do <x thing>, but that isnt always true cuz-""  
or B. develop a general solution to it that'll work for any given scale, unlike newton's equation, and also give humanity a better understanding of the subject.

a chemist would've said A is the right way to go about it.

i fuckin hate chemistry what the actual fuck is this subject  
imo, if your laws deviates INCONSISTENTLY, then the law has failed. and trying to justify it further is just an act of laziness.

In practice it's just very aggravating that I'm having to waste more time on classes that will be useless in the long run than I'm actually spending on building the skills I need for my desired career. My degree (creative writing) has nothing to do with either science or math and yet I need to take multiple levels of both. I have to take so many levels of languages which I'm almost certainly going to forget the instant it becomes unnecessary for my continued college life. There's also a ton of elective stuff which I won't list or else we'd be here all day. 

And some of these classes have been so difficult for me  that it's honestly making it hard to keep going knowing that there's even more advanced levels of it that I have to take before the college is satisfied. When it comes to the classes that I actually need, I've been doing very well. Excelling even. It's all these classes that have nothing to do with my degree that are really just dragging me down right now. Some I've barely passed just by the skin of my teeth and yet somehow I'm expected to do it again but even harder next time.  It's tiring to even think about and it's incredibly frustrating since I do well with the classes that are actually relevant and if I could just stick to that stuff I wouldn't really be having any stress right now. I hate that I'm being so overloaded with all of this extra stuff that is never going to help me in life solely to satisfy the big-wigs of the college so that they can advertise their ""well-rounded"" students. I hate to say it but if this is what it takes to be ""well-rounded"" then I don't really want it. I'm perfectly fine just knowing all the stuff I need to know thank you very much.

In a previous post I lamented about my professor moving our class to zoom because of her cancer treatments. Despite not signing up for a zoom class because I HATE zoom after using it for all of high school, I've dealt with it decently

Now today I got an email that she can no longer make our class time (4pm) due to her treatment schedule.

242,Haven't been able to make it to my physics lab once this semester,20,"I've been in undergrad for almost seven years. Some semesters I had to drop out because I simply couldn't afford it, other semesters I could only afford to take a few classes at a time. This semester is supposed to be my last, and I cannot wait for it to be over. I'm so miserable.

The issue is that last semester I had to move over an hour away from campus due to unavoidable issues, and I can't afford rent anywhere closer to campus. On Tuesdays, I have a 9 AM physics lab, and I have missed it every single week so far. Two of those weeks there was no lab, so in total I've missed 4 out of 13 labs. 

Traffic is significantly worse on Tuesday mornings, and it's taken me over 2 hours to get to campus every time. My professor is super strict about getting there on time, which is fair enough. He says that the first 10 minutes of lab are spent explaining the procedure/what we'll be doing, so if you miss that, you're useless to your lab partners. 

Everyone keeps telling me to just wake up earlier, but that's not the solution they think it is. The reason being that if I wake up any earlier, I won't get any sleep. The commute doesn't only effect me in the mornings, but going home too. I get out of my last class on Monday right at rush hour, so I stick around campus and study to wait it out. Also, if I do go home immediately, I have no energy to study. Sitting in bumper to bumper traffic for an hour and a half is so mind-numbing. So sticking around campus is the only way I'll get anything done.  

I typically get home around 10, after which I have to pack all of my food for the next day (I'm on campus all day so I have to pack or prepare all my meals), get ready for bed, etc. I usually get into bed around 11:30 and don't fall asleep until after midnight. I can't wake up any earlier then I already am without completely sacrificing my sleep!

I'm at a total loss. I'm so worn out from all these years in school and to be this close to the finish line with the worry in mind that I will yet again have to take ANOTHER semester makes me want to blow my brains out. The huge increase in prices of literally everything the past couple years have made being a working college student so much more difficult, I don't know how anyone is managing it without coming from a wealthy family. 

Not really looking for any advice per se, just wanted to vent. So far all of the advice I get is people saying ""tough luck that's life for you"" which is not only unhelpful, but extremely condescending. I'm tired of people (professors, advisors, other students, people on this subreddit) acting as if you can't handle academia, then you'll never make it in the ""real world"".

First test of the semester was scheduled for 2/8 in the syllabus and in Canvas. On 2/1, she sent an announcement titled “TEST 1 closes tonight at 11:59” in the afternoon. My heart dropped. I thought I’d messed up when writing down my due dates and scheduling my studying. Three hours later, she sent a new announcement saying “TEST DOES NOT CLOSE TONIGHT” saying she doesn’t want to add to anyone’s stress and it was an error.

i also don’t want to go to cc because a pretty big amount of kids i go to school with will go to the same ones. not saying that i don’t like them or anything, but id rather branch out and not be stuck with the same people i’ve been with for the past 4-6 years. 

i don’t think cc is bad in any way, it’s a totally valid option and i know plenty of people who love it and it’s just not for me.

i do believe that i could do a program where i graduate in 3 years which would save some money and i may consider it. i’m applying to scholarships right now and i’m also going to be applying throughout my college career.

i just feel like ill regret it but it’s what i’m committing to. i’m very frugal to begin with and i’m gonna save as much as i can but its just so sobering to think about.

It’s midterms week and I was trying to study for our midterm on Wednesday but there’s too much background noise because these people aren’t using headphones. I’m so annoyed and also so damn grateful that I won’t have to take my exam in the same room as the inconsiderate people because I have distraction reduced environment accommodations. ,WildForestFerret

250,"Last semester, my grades are getting screwed ",10,"I already posted a bit about my hard situation on here and received a lot of really nice support. Thanks everyone ❤️

I’m going to meet with my academic advisor to discuss possible options in regards to my course load. I’m extremely overwhelmed and a bit dysfunctional with this whole situation. I  spend pretty much every day and many hours at the hospital, I do all of my homework there which isn’t ideal and it’s hard to do, especially in the ICU. 

As a result, I’ve been very behind on a lot and my work quality is pretty shitty. Doesn’t help that I have an internship. Ive been trying to keep this part of my life private but me having a panic attack and breaking down in front of my professors made that kind of hard lol. I’ve communicated with some of my professors and they’ve been very kind and understanding so far. This hard situation has been going on for a few weeks but it feels like it’s been going on for like a year. 

I feel bad for doing shit but I really don’t have any energy. I’m going to discuss more on what I can do with my advisor. Just wanted to rant a bit, thank you all for the kind words. I’m just very stressed, anxious, and depressed. It sucks that it’s my last semester but family comes first. ",throwaway1283415
251,"So a professor refused to let me attend a lesson because ""I was late"", when in fact I was only late by a few seconds",1352,"I really need to rant somewhere because I'm really furious right now, so prepare yourself for a long post.

So I'm an engineering student, and I have this one Algebra prof who's really competent, but also incredibly strict when it comes to tardiness. She usually only allows students to be late by like 3-4 mins before closing the door, without even giving you the chance to explain why you're late. You could be 5 minutes late because of a natural disaster or something, and she'll still refuse to let you in.

Anyways, today, the prof herself was late, and while waiting for her, I was talking to a friend of mine (from another class). As soon as I saw her approaching, I told my friend ""Aight, my prof is here, so we'll continue our chat later"" and followed the prof to the class. Just as I was about to enter, she slammed the door in my face, which surprised me. I thought ""Maybe she didn't see me"" and knocked. When she opened the door, I asked her if I could enter, and to my surprise, she refused and told me ""If you actually valued this class, you wouldn't be late"", and no matter how hard I tried, she wouldn't let me in. Even the rest of my classmates were shocked (I could see them from the door), and I was so furious but I tried to not show it. So I asked her if I could at least enter the class to take my notebooks and laptop, which were inside, and again, she refused! Like wtf, at least allow me to take my things. But no, apparently being late by like 5 seconds or so means that I'm not legally allowed to take stuff that belongs to me.

I have no idea why she did all that. I'm always on time and I never came late to any of her classes, and I always pay attention and don't disturb her while she's doing her job. So all of this was a surprise to me, and I've been really angry the whole day because of it. Maybe I am just being bitter or something, but did I actually do anything wrong here? Because I really feel she treated me very unfairly.",A_Round_of_Gwent
252,I love STEM but I feel like I'm too dumb to actually deserve to learn it,96,"I (F19) am a sophomore in university doing a BS in physics and math.

I have never been the smart kid, even in middle/elementary school.
I only did decent in highschool because of COVID online school, but really I'm just not smart.

I originally applied for engineering but was rejected from everywhere (mainly because engineering required supplemental applications which I probably fucked up)

I don't know why if I wasn't smart enough for engineering I'd be smart enough for my current degree, I'm not, and I can feel it. I can see it when other people get things that I just don't. 

I don't even hate learning, every once in a while  my useless brain will actually turn and I'll process some new information and I'm genuinely fascinated about certain topics, but I just know I can't actually study them with my mind. 

I would have loved to do engineering, I still sometimes want to, but in my country engineering programs are very regulated so I'd have to start from year 1 so I don't know if I should transfer 
I also don't know I'd I'd even get it my GPA is gonna be like a 2.7-3.1 at the end of the year
...and I don't think I even deserve to study it at this point because I was already rejected before. 

I love doing things and I love figuring out how things work. I also love science and discovering new information. 
Since starting college I've also started coding which has been a lot of fun.

I just don't think I have the intelligence to be useful in these feilds. I'm extremely slow at processing information and I don't know if I have good problem solving skills, I feel like I can't actually solve any problems on my own, I always need to ask for help.

I feel like an idiot who just has unrealistic dreams of being a genius.

254,Who Decided to have their midterm during spring break?,12,"Title. 

It’s just a bit annoying. We had a poll for doing a take-home midterm this week (break) or next week.

I understand people don’t want to do more work after break but unless you’re spending midterm week trying to get this done as well as all your other midterms… you have to have the equivalent of a gaming computer to run the program to do the midterm. 

I realize I should’ve just sucked it up and gotten it done but I had 3 other midterms to study for and a trip to pack for… gah. 

This isn’t really a “write stuff down” class so I guess I learned my lesson and write down every step because now I have to master the art of Googling words I barely know about…

TL;DR: Thought I had more time to do a midterm before break because it’s due the day we get back but no. Now I have to Google random terms to figure stuff out on my PC because I’m not at the class desktop. ",WonderMoon1
255,Either put the correct information in the syllabus or don’t put it at all ,959,"Decided to take chorus this semester, had a dress rehearsal yesterday. Fully intended on attending, but I couldn’t remember the exact time we were meant to show up so I checked the syllabus, where it said 7-9pm. 

Showed up at 7, nobody is there. Check canvas, and *big surprise* there’s an entirely separate module I didn’t see stating that dress rehearsal was actually 12-3pm. 

Professor told us if we couldn’t attend dress, we couldn’t perform, so guess who’s getting two consecutive grades that are just gonna bring my average down? Emailed the professor and explained what happened, but he either doesn’t care or hasn’t checked because I never got a response. 

I stressed all day about being on time to dress rehearsal and look what fucking happens?? Normally I’d blame myself, but I wouldn’t have actually missed it, had the information actually been correct in the syllabus! So I’m honestly angry and bummed out. ",glittery_Sandwhich

It’s not even school that is the problem I don’t find it that challenging so far. I just hate where I live now. I’ve talked to a lot of people and got acquainted with them but I just have no desire to make new friends. I’m just so mentally tired.

257,I don’t think it’s worth the money saved commuting ,30,"I'm a junior at uni, and I commute about 30–45 minutes each way. Initially, I thought it was a smart move to save money, but now I'm regretting the hell out of it. I feel like I'm missing out on so much.

Networking is a struggle for me as a commuter. People always talk about how important it is in college, or how it’s literally the main reason to go,  but I find it really hard to to talk to anyone - nobody really connects in my classes. 

And forget something even close to the college experience. My routine is pretty much just going to class and then heading straight home. It's tough to get involved in clubs too, especially when their meetings start late when classes end (so around 7-8pm) and I have to factor in my commute. I know that one is on me, but man it’s a pain to drive for about an hour, go to a meeting for about an hour, and drive right back - at night. 

If I lived by campus this would’ve been different. A 15 minute walk to the club meeting, more social connections with the people around me, etc. 

I keep thinking that if I had lived closer to campus, I would've had a more balanced life. More social interaction and a better grasp on adulting. I still live with my parents, and I feel like I'm missing out on growing up. I’m just watching the biggest opportunities of my life slip by. It doesn’t seem like they’re so big, but everyone’s always talking about these lifelong connections in college - both in terms of just personal and career wise. People talking about post college socializing are just giving warnings that it's going to be even harder once I graduate. 

I know I made the decision to commute, but man, I hate it. I don’t think the money I'm saving is really worth it. I feel like I am less well rounded solely because I’m commuting. I feel so stupid saying that but I feel like I can trace every single thing back to the fact that I’m commuting. 

I get that my main goal here is to get my degree, but with all the talk about graduates struggling to find jobs, it's hard not to doubt the value of it all. I feel like if I hadn't chosen to commute, I'd feel more connected and better prepared for life after college. The debt feels worth it to me. But the grass is always greener i guess. ",conefucker
258,A rant about my roommate,18,"My college roommate is annoying me a lot. For some reason she thinks it’s perfectly fine for her to pick at me, but when I tease her, she’s terribly offended. She was just telling me off saying I take a long time to get ready in the morning (20 minutes) so I said that that’s isn’t a long time. Then she asked if she annoyed me and I told her the truth (which she is already well aware of) and told her that she does annoy me when she throws her trash at me for no reason or makes annoying noises for attention. After I explained this to her, she immediately turned out the light in our room and laid down in her bed. 

She’s so sensitive, but when she says offensive things to me (calling me dumb even through I am constantly holding her hand and helping her with her work, calls me lazy even though I always get my work done quickly and keep my part of the room clean). She’s just rude and I’m sick of it.

Something else is that she acts like I don’t have work to do when I do. The difference is that I do my homework in the library away from her (because she likes to distract me because she craves attention) and therefore she doesn’t see me do it. But I have been getting ahead on my work on the weekends when she’s there. 

I just can’t stand her.

TLDR: My roommate keeps annoying me because she calls me dumb and lazy even though I’m anything but. I finally told her that she annoys me (which is something she already knew and jokes about) and she got offended. ",Level_Isopod_4011
259,Studied really hard for an exam and got a C because I missed questions,66,"Yeah basically the title.  I've been good at school since I was a child and I think growing up constantly being praised for my academic achievements aided in me tying my identity to my grades.  My goal this semester is to have As in everything and I think I could if I tried because I tend to have all As, and my easiest subject this semester is actually Calculus 2.  

The thing is, we only have 4 exams, 3 of them being 20 points of our grade, and then 10 homework sets that are each worth 2 points of our grade.  I did my first exam after studying really hard and got a 70 SOLELY because I got nervous, skimmed the exam when I was done and ended up missing half of a problem and skipping 2 completely even though I knew how to do them because I wasn't paying attention and just wanted to leave.  So currently, my grade in Calculus is a 75 (C) and there's nothing I can do at the moment to change it but everytime I think about it I feel ashamed and like crying.  

 I cried like 4 times when I first saw my grade because I was certain I'd gotten close to a perfect score because I knew the content so well so I was really disappointed in myself.  Like I said, I could still end up with an A at the end of the semester (and I would accept a B) if I tried hard enough but just knowing that I currently have a C and literally could've had an A for the whole semester if I'd just listened to my gut and not left the exam earlier than I needed to makes me so mad.  I feel like I need to put my whole life on pause until all my grades are Bs and up.  I need to get over this so I can continue with the rest of the school semester and my LIFE without this cloud of guilt and shame and the feeling that I've lost all my value because I messed up an exam but I kind of lost all motivation and feel like giving up.

260,RANT: Full time job and full time college student needing to vent about shit life lol,19,"My apologies all this is going to sound negative but everything feels extremely shit right now haha.

I don't have anyone to go to for comfort or sympathy (not even my own family tbh), and I've had several mental breakdowns during midterms already lol.

Ever since I started this semester I've been constantly working like a slave non stop trying to balance school work and my job so I can pay my bills. (Sadly I'm not in a position to quit my job and I don't get help from family either.) I work at Amazon on night shifts 30 hours a week (mostly on weekends) and have class during the weekdays. If anyone is wondering why I didn't reduce my hours earlier it's because Amazon has a tuition assistance program only offered to full time and part-time employees. There weren't any part time positions opened at my site before so I had to stay full time until the company finalized my tuition payment for the year.

I originally planned to cut my hours down to be a flex associate prior (working minimum or 4 hours a week) but, like I said, couldn't change over until Amazon fully processed my tuition payment which took them until about mid February to do.

I put in my transfer request in weeks ago which took them weeks to review and they only approved it a few days ago. Pretty much after midterms. After all the hell and mental breakdowns I've been through. lol

Just to add, no I'm not failing any of my course nor have I missed any assignments (I have an A in every course and soon to be low B in graphic design  unfortunately). I got a low C on my midterms by a few point and that shit grade dropped my A down to a low B in that class. I feel like crawling in a corner now and crying because I told my graphic design professor months ago I would cut my hours so I could do better on my second project (got a B on the first) only to do much worse). I feel like she's disappointed in me now because she seemed like she thought I'd do really good on this project at first only to fall short again.

Funny enough, I don't think my classes are too difficult for me actually but as with most art classes, they are very time consuming especially when you get into the upper level course and the demand gets higher. My issue is that I have damn none of the time I actually need for many of my assignments and my sleep schedule is all over the damn place if I sleep at all. Btw I have 3 studio art course on the same day and there's just been several times I never slept the day before those day because all the work I had to do for those days.

Oh, and I must rant about this other art professor I've absolutely grown to loath. lol

Not only is she rather condescending and passive aggressive, she assigns a RIDICULOUS amount of busy/work homework and claims it's the normal amount for a 200 level art course when it most certainly isn't. I have taken art classes before up to the 400 level at a previous university with a different major and I can still say my current professor in this class is cat shit crazy with her assignments.

There are even certain assignment to which she tells us we need to have a certain grade in one off assignments just to pass the class! Really? Is that even allowed? Just because a student get one not so good grade on a assignment it's completely over for them?

I'm especially frustrated with this class because it's right before my graphic design class. Doing this professors absurd assignments comes at the expense of my graphic design class and the weight of everything felt like it came crashing down on me when I got my graphic design midterm grade today.

At the end of the day I know I'm responsible for managing my own time but, just being treated like I'm a lazy ass sometimes really hurts when I've been working my ass off. 

I guess pray for me or send some good will if you can.

261,I am having an existential crisis right now,93,"I started college right after high school and didn’t do well. I was working full time, roughly 60 hours a week and my grades suffered so I never finished.

Fast forward ~10 years, I worked hard and saved my money and went back for a new bachelors degree. I have maintained an A/B average the last 4 years and have done everything I was told to do. Unfortunately, due to my previous transcripts, my gpa is still only a 2.8, and while I realize that will affect getting into a grad school program, I figured that I could potentially show them that I have done well for all of my courses for this specific degree. My advisors have agreed with this. I also planned on working in my new field for a year before applying for grad school.

I received an email yesterday from someone in administration in response to my graduation application for the end of this semester with a graduation audit. 

It said that my degree required a 3.0 gpa minimum to graduate and that I would have to reapply for graduation after I fixed it. I cannot find this information anywhere stating that my degree requires a minimum gpa. After calculating it, I would have to maintain a 4.1 in all of my courses this semester in order to raise my gpa to the minimum before graduation, which isn’t possible.

 The closest I could find was in my specific degree’s course catalog maintaining a 3.0 for my degree’s honors status which I am not in. I also found a minimum 3.0 gpa for a similar program, but it looks like it hasn’t been offered since 2017 and they changed that program into my current program right after. My advisor’s have maintained that I should be able to graduate in May and have never mentioned the gpa minimum. I obviously emailed them and hope to receive a response on Monday. 

I just got a job offer to start after I graduate in May, contingent on obtaining my degree. I am absolutely freaking out and this couldn’t be a worse time to receive the news. I am taking 23 hours this semester in order to finish my degree (I transferred halfway through and it messed my timeline up). I literally have 6 exams and a final next week (that will bring me back down to 20 hours) I have been studying for and now my mind isn’t in it. I was doing so well, I don’t know what to do.

Tl;dr : No one told me that my degree had a minimum gpa requirement above my current gpa and I am supposed to graduate in 2 months. I am freaking out.",sarcasticb

I literally stayed up all night twice last week and study over 15 hours for the weekly quizzes but I can’t stay consistent. 

I really don’t see much value in myself beyond my grades and this failure is going to be massively disappointing to my family.

Just give up and embrace life as a mediocre student?

It was a random “wellness check”, but now I’m fucking paranoid as hell. Even the police showed up because apparently, we’re under suspicion for harboring someone. The cops start telling me they’re tired of our crap and if they find that person here we’re getting in legal trouble, but I have absolutely nothing to do with that shit.

265,I didn't last a week.,3,"In high school, I was never a social butterfly. In fact, I hated being alone so much that I graduated a year early in hopes of the college experience being better (fun fact: I was the only one who didn't get any applause while walking up to get my diploma. And I counted.) They all said it would be. I did well academically in high school so I expected to do well in college. 

Come the move-in day I never really saw any problems with my roommate, though we had nothing in common. Unpacked and then went to dinner, sat alone as usual, everyone seemed to already have their friend groups lined out somehow and I didn't want to intrude. As you can probably guess I didn't make a single friend there. 

All but 2 of my classes were online; I wanted to go in-person to the ones I cared about and do the rest of the gen-ed stuff (math, public speaking, science) online. The only one of all of these I passed was science.  

I have a hearing disorder that I won't go into much detail in but it requires people to repeat themselves often. One of the two in-person classes was Japanese. You can guess how the first day of that went (I was extremely embarrassed as I had to ask the teacher for instructions again while everyone else was cruising along fine)  

The only class that went well was an English course. I liked the professor, he was understanding about my disorder and said he'd make accommodations, and the content seemed interesting.  I took all my food to-go to my dorm because I was too embarrassed to sit alone in the cafeteria. As stated earlier, everyone had their friend groups lined out and it's rude to inject yourself into those situations.   

My roommate woke me up at 6 A.M one day we didn't have classes to tell me to flush my toilet paper. I was told to never do this by my parents and I still don't know what the socially acceptable thing to do is. Things like these seem to magically come to everyone but me.   

Another day, my roommate was up at 3 A.M loudly giggling to tiktok videos. I didn't get any sleep and completely overslept for my classes despite multiple alarms. 

That was the day I called my parents and told them I couldn't take it anymore. Couldn't make any friends, sat alone in my dorm all day, overslept for the SECOND day of classes. 

I ended up dropping every in-person class and doing the rest of the semester online. As stated previously, I only passed the science course. Everytime I tried to start an essay for Sociology, I couldn't get a single sentence in without deleting it instantly in a fit of self loathing. Same deal with public speaking, only I couldn't say a sentence out loud.  

I want to go back because 

1. I can't see myself doing any trades or something that doesn't require an education. I'm not physically fit, sociable, or good at math at all. That rules out almost everything well-paying, and well-paying is a requirement in this dumpster of an economy.

2. I want to have some semblance of a social life before I inevitably rot alone in my room all day with no skills or ability to move out, especially in this economy. I live in a rural area so unless you have a group of friends, there is no way to meet people and nothing to do. I haven't had a stable friendship since I was a pre-teen, never got to go to parties, go out to eat, do anything with other people. 

However, I forfeited all my scholarships by failing all but one of my classes and I don't think my parents will pay for any of it after what I did (they initially said they'd pay 2/4 years). And obviously I have no idea what I'll do differently. It might even be too late to apply for classes and housing for next semester. It's way too embarrassing to e-mail someone in the housing department and say ""Hey I failed all but one of my classes, my roommate ruined everything for me, is there any way I can get a dorm for next semester, vetted for someone who isn't obnoxious?"" 

I feel like I'm completely stuck in life.

267,My university president has removed the stage at graduation for the past year and I couldn’t care le,414,"For the last few graduations, our university president decided to remove the stage at graduation for “safety reasons”. There has been outrage about it since and I honestly don’t understand it.

Everything about the graduation process is the exact same, just without the stage. People are still walking, achievements are being recognized, it is at the same venue, etc. The only thing different is people are walking a few feet lower than usual.

If I were in their shoes, I’d be grateful that I at least get to walk. It’s not like they completely removed the graduation ceremony, just the stage.

My feelings could be a result of my high school graduation only being a slide show on a local tv channel (Thanks to COVID), but it seems like everyone is just being a bit ungrateful.

I try to make an effort to be friendly and positive, almost to a point where I’m walking on eggshells trying not to say anything wrong but at the same time be approachable. but I don’t know if that’s what’s keeping people away from me or maybe I’m not interesting enough as a person that others want to hang out with me in a more social capacity. either way it’s super isolating. all I know is I’m not happy and I want friends who care for me as I do for them.

I heard freshman year is the most fun year and I just wasted it. 

I have some friends and am in two clubs, but all my friends seem closer to other friends.

Wasn't expecting that to continue at graduate-level but here we are. Group-project based class, and the only one working in my group. Did 95% of the first reports workload, leaving the others two days to do the tidbits rest. Communicated what they had to do and how to do it.

No answer for two days. 

The morning of the due date, they wake up from their ghosting stance to rush up their job (forgetting half the prompt given and my recommendations ofc). And doing so with a sassy attitude.

273,Tired of group projects where we don’t get to pick our partners. Idk what to do anymore,16,"My group project buddy has not done a single thing in the past 3 weeks that we’ve known about this project. We are the only group of 2 while everyone else is a group of 3. 

All we had to do was find 15 sources each for our essay by yesterday (we legit had around 3 weeks to do this.) and yesterday our professor told us to find 15 more each. He even gave us time IN CLASS to find some and he did nothing. So now he has to find 30 by Monday and not be duplicates of mine

This will be hard because we have to find the pros, cons, and general info about vaping/smoking. Its hard to find anything that doesn’t bash smoking as it’s taken me hours to find even a few of them. And our professor has high expectations/standards for our sources so we really have to dissect them and look at every authors biography etc. 

I have texted him multiple times over the past few weeks asking if he needed help because english is not his first language and I wanted to make sure he understood how to find the sources and how to format them into MLA format. No reply. My friends are all telling me to just find the sources for him but I’m not gonna be doing most of the work when we already have more work than any other group. The other groups only have to find 45 sources total while we have to find 60 total. This essay will be about 10 pages long and I’m not doing all of the work. 

Rant over, I’m just tired of this. I want to help him but it seems pointless. I don’t want to fail this class as I desperately need a good grade to get into my next college. If this keeps up I’ll have to talk to my professor about it because I’m not going down like this.

If younger me saw the way I struggle academically she wouldn’t even believe that we were ever the same person. I feel like I’m doing what I can given my mental state but simultaneously I’m angry at myself for not reaching my full potential. Like why can’t I just push past it and block everything out to excel academically. On top of that I just feel like I’m constantly disappointing my peers when my mental health issues get in the way of finishing my work efficiently to compare our homework answers or participating in group study sessions. I wish I could hard reset my brain, but college has just been difficult for me. Logically, I know my grades aren’t bad, with a mix of A’s and B’s but none of that feels real to me. My therapist has always tried to remind me of an objective perspective on my academic performance but that just feels like I’m lowering my standards for myself.

I feel like I'm trying so hard just for it to constantly get kicked down. I look over the book and make flashcards. I do all my homework and go to tutoring. And yet I still go to take the test and can't seem to get it right

The test is so much harder then the homework. I get the vocab and understanding conversation for the most part. But I have a very basic understanding on the rules. Like I understand the concept of estar vs ir and can do the homework exercises. But when the test doesn't match the homework I get what I'm supposed to do but I'm not fully sure how to do it. 

Most of the test was just language rules which is a small of the chapter. Most of the vocabulary I studied wasn't even present.  

I was so stressed because the test system is complete ass. Timed, complete lockdown browser, camera on, and you can't go back to an question once you move on. 

I feel like they want me to just connect the dots automatically but I don't have a strong enough understanding to do that yet.

280,How should I report this? Students with Disabilities/Accommodations,7,"Hi guys,

TLDR; who should I report misconduct of testing center accommodations staff at my university to?

This is my first post here, bear with me, but I'm hoping for some advice on what to do with a situation between myself and some of the staff at the testing center at my university - I'm not looking for responses on what I should have done, since I feel pretty good about sticking up for myself, but rather advice on who to report this situation to so the staff member does not perpetuate her behavior onto other students.

I get testing accommodations at my university, which I have plenty of documentation for and approval from my psychiatrist. 

Besides the point, I had an open note open book exam, where use of a computer was also permitted. My instructor documented these, verbatim, as the allowed materials for the exam. Note that he did not say that a laptop charger, iPad, mouse, calculator, or even a pencil was a permitted material, that'll be important!

I go to take my exam with all my materials in my backpack, which included several different things that would have been a pain to just lug in there. I figure since it was open note, open book, laptop permitted that it'd be perfectly acceptable to go in there with my backpack with my materials. This wasn't the case, since ""the instructor didn't say in the testing agreement you could have your backpack, they have to put that in there - we HAVE to go by what the computer says."" Which I acknowledged, but then said that I should have access to the same materials as my peers, where they were permitted to have everything with them, including their backpack, and to just call the instructor to get clarification PER THEIR OWN PROCEDURE (if there is a question or concern raised regarding the exam, contact the instructor). Instead of doing so, she proceeded to get extremely aggressive with me and was huffing, puffing, sighing, rolling her eyes, slamming her hands down on the desk, pointing her finger at me, and just generally being nasty toward me for a solid 10 minutes. I'll admit, I was definitely giving it back, but I don't like being bullied into submission, especially given that her reasoning didn't make sense, because by her own logic, I should not have been able to bring a calculator, iPad, or even a pencil in with me. 

Her solution was to have instead me shlep all of my stuff into my testing room, use my own test time to unpack what was needed, shlep my backpack back to lock it up, then when I was done taking the test, take all my stuff out of the room and into my backpack. It was an absurd solution. Continuing the debate with her, for me, was truly a matter of principle. The accommodations are meant to provide a level playing field for students with disabilities, not to add additional and ridiculous hurdles on top of what they're already struggling with.

After she realized I wasn't going to back down, she finally picked up the phone and followed their own procedure, which it seems like they like to pick and choose when to follow based on when it's convenient for them, and my instructor was incredibly irritated that she had called and confirmed what I had said, and she was super rude to him on the phone as well.

First of all, I felt super embarrassed because she had said that I was frustrated, which could have implied I was upset at my instructor which I 100% was NOT, the testing agreement he put forth was pretty clear and the staff member I was dealing with was just a nasty woman. Second off, her conduct in general, whether or not one agrees that I should've just shut up and did what I was told, was extremely unprofessional. In addition to this nasty lady, another staff member was SNEERING and laughing at me in the office, which I found equally disgusting. I don't think a student advocating for themselves is funny. I get it was just a backpack and in the grand scheme of life, it's not a big deal, but it's discriminatory to apply arbitrary rules without rhyme or reason just because a student has to take their test there due to a disability. 

I'm wondering if anyone could advise me on who to report this woman's conduct to. I worry that a student with severe mental health issues could experience a similar situation to mine and it be the one thing that puts them over the edge - I don't think the university would be happy to know these are the people who represent the staff who supposedly assist students with their accommodations and represent the university's standpoint on students with disabilities.

287,Online Homework.,7,"I just wanted to post to see if anyone shared the same feelings as me, or to ask for a potential solution. 

This is my final semester at my community college until I transfer and I've noticed that I have an extremely hard time with online homework sites. Specifically the one all of the math classes use (Edfinity). It's not the content in the homework but the website itself that causes me the most pain. I don't understand why trying to learn how to do a problem should cost $5.99 a month. Or how an ""ai-powered assistant"" that costs ""$8.99"" a month isn't just a scam? I'm already paying for my tuition out of pocket and when struggling on a problem having these price tags be my only solution is really a huge letdown and major source of my depression. 

I originally paid $40 dollars for access only to just enter text into a box and see if I am right or wrong. I've had to do this for 4 semesters now and I hate it every time. Is it just the pure laziness of community college professors? Or does my college get money thrown in it's face for using these websites? Either way I don't see a solution to my struggle. It also doesn't help that half of the time when I enter an incorrect answer it tells me that I am wrong without providing where I went wrong or hints for the answer. 
I have dealt with other online sites such as ALEKS and My labs from Pearson and have had less frustration with them as they actually tell you how to arrive to the answer instead of telling you that you have to pay money to get help with them. I have considered tutoring but never have the time to do it. 

I honestly just needed to get this off my chest as this one homework website has been causing me major stress, and a bad grade. I find that doing the homework on there is a waste of my time and effort and I would honestly receive a bad grade instead of the pain that this site causes. 

TL;DR: Edfinity is a poorly designed, expensive, and depression causing home work site that my college is using because it's an easy way for professors to send out homework. Does anyone else share my feelings?",StraightOutta2Fort

I'm half considering withdrawing because my grade in that class is not great even with the grace period she gives for late work. I had her English comp class last semester and did really well, so she knows I can do better than this. I don't want to meet with her just to whine, but I feel like I should talk to her about how I'm feeling/doing in the class and see what she thinks.

It's community college so I'm not as *worried* about my GPA as I would be at a 4-year, but it was really good last semester and it kind of makes me sad that it's probably going to be worse this time. I might be being too hard on myself though. And it kind of feels silly to pull out halfway through the semester anyway.

It’s so bad to the point I’ve had an entire class laugh at me and/look at each other like “what did she just say?”. It’s even worse when I say something or think I’m doing well and I’m met with complete silence and everyone is just looking at each other.

I know I shouldn’t care about what people think but I also can’t help the fact that all of my classmates think I’m a complete dumbass.

I truly can’t handle being put on the spot for anything. I literally feel like I’m gonna have a panic attack every single time. It’s gotten so bad to the point where I’m a shut in with no friends because people see me as stupid and won’t even want to sit next to me, which is fine, but damn.

I just wish that all I had to do was homework, at least then it wouldn’t be so obvious that I’m stupid.

I can’t wait till I graduate.

TL;DR: I can’t handle being put on the spot and get exposed/laughed at/judged for being stupid. It’s weighing heavily on my mental health and is making me hate myself as a student and classmate.",blooooooop_

297, Feeling like a failure,12,"I don’t know where to go with my life; I’m just so upset at how things are looking. I feel like I wasted my first 2 years doing a degree I was lied to about. My high school counselor told me this degree would get me into the legal field, and they were just straight up wrong. I ultimately realized too late and I only had 2 more classes to do, so I fought through to get my associates.

I’m so so so sick of being at a community college, and I had to quickly switch majors, so now I’m here for longer. Nobody talks to anybody; I try so hard to be social with everyone but never pushy, and friendships never last there.

I really just want a normal college experience away from my toxic family. I want to move away to a uni and make enough money to never need to rely on them again.

I ended up changing major to business and Yk I've been told I have a business-like personality (I like to work with others, I try to communicate well, I like details, etc.) but with business, you have to declare a major at your uni, and I'm stuck between 2-3 of them. I honestly feel like such a fool. I wish I wasn’t first-gen with parents who actually wanted me to go to college instead of being a housewife. I wish I were better at math. I wish my parents supported me academically instead of making me cook 6 servings of food every day and clean up after everyone (grown ass people) before work. I wish I knew what to do. 

I have a good amount in my savings and a GPA on the higher side. But I feel like there’s no one to guide me, and I’m getting increasingly more frustrated and feeling more stupid. I know I need to just fight through and self discover (as much as I can while I’m stuck at home) but I’m really upset. I don’t feel like things are working out. I kinda wanna just cry.

299,Depressed that I barely made progress for 2 years,11,"I was at a college for 2 years studying math and the work was hard but I did well in the classes. Then the moment I transferred everything went to shit. I didn't realize that I only did well in math during college because the courses were computational based. But upper division courses are all proof based math, and since I despise and suck at proofs I panicked and dropped all my upper division math courses and run away from the math program. I spent the next semester taking a variety of electives to see if anything interests me but to no avail. I tried math the following semester but couldn't push myself through the proofs so I dropped the math courses once again. I spent the semester after taking a different set of electives but my mental health got so bad that I dropped almost all courses that semester and here we are now. I took the next semester off just working and volunteering but I feel so lost that I can't figure out what I like and what I should major in. Well, out of the electives that included economics, computer science, statistics, cognitive science, linguistics, philosophy, english, etc. I genuinely enjoyed moral based philosophy and adored logic, but I'll be the first to acknowledge that Philosophy isn't all that employable of a major. Now I just feel stuck. I can study something I enjoy with little to no job prospects, or spend the next few years miserably studying an employable major like computer science or something. I'm just sad that ever since I transferred from college, I made little to no progress in my university journey. ",Magical_critic

301,Lost half of my exam,147,"So I recently had an exam that was like half written responses and half multiple choice. Due to my disability, I get a time-and-a-half on exams and a word processor to write my written responses. So I took my exam in my schools testing center, felt really good about it.

I got my score back last week. 50.50/93 (54%). I felt devastated since I could've sworn I passed it. I went to look over my exam and realized NONE of my written responses were on the handed back assignment. 

I reached out to the testing center, turns out they completely lost my written responses. My teacher responded to the emails (he was cc'd) and basically just said ""sorry"" and that I should've made sure the testing center submitted my entire exam.

I'm so devastated. I looked at the answer sheet and I swear I would of had at least an 80% with my written responses. 

I'm not looking for advice over what to do, but if you have any please send it my way. I'm just venting ATP.




Additional information that might be asked: 1.) The testing center scans and sends the exams to the teacher. I got a scanned copy of my exam back.
2.) The testing center also saves and submits the written responses, since we are not allowed to log into our own accounts due to fear of us cheating, we are logged in under the testing centers personal account.
3.) I've used the testing center for 4 semesters now, never had this issue.

The least you could do is give a glance at the data, takes literally three lines of code in python (import pandas, read_csv, print dataframe). They can't even be bothered to do that. 

Everything they've contributed is secondhand stuff from the people who have done actual work, just repeating the words we've said without doing ANY research or again, looking at the freaking data we're working with. And the work they've done is bad because they don't know what we're actually doing, is this just weaponized incompetence? I feel like we've tried bringing them up to speed many times, and never once have they acted like they really cared. I've accepted that I can't get them to ""care"" about the project, but that leaves the other members to carry their weight.

I'm just so burnt out. Didn't touch the class material much in the past week or so in an online, asynchronous class with no professor guidance and very sparse due dates, and it really showed on this exam I just took. 

I did study somewhat going into it despite slacking recently. The past few days I've been reviewing the powerpoints, looking at past HW questions, rereading some of the text, but I just... panicked? I must have reviewed the wrong things because it was like reading latin. I recognized some of the concepts, but I just completely blanked. Finished the exam in like 15 minutes because I was about to cry, lol.

I normally don't panic on exams, and I'm used to getting A's, but I just completely froze and gave up.

So, I got a grand ol' 64% on what is supposed to be the easiest exam of the course. My very first D of my college career.

It's so stressful having to worry about if it's just me or the super outdated files and labs not being updated and maintained. I feel I'm not learning a single thing out of any of this, because it also doesn't go back to any of what was taught before.

""How do you do fellow kids?"" I come in peace, I am a solo indie iOS developer with just two apps under my belt with an idea for a third. I'd like to improve the experience of searching for off-campus housing for college students through an app. I know there's Zillow, I know there's Collegepads... but they're kinda shit aren't they? What if there was one app you can download, that you knew was strictly tailored around off-campus living? Would that be appealing?

I envision this being very visually striking, modern, with portrait mode only listing photos (no rotating necessary), high-quality listings, star ratings & reviews of landlords & their properties, and I think it'd be great to have some kind of secondhand marketplace for furniture swapping or school supply swapping for when you navigate from ""dorm to door,"" if you will.

Writing my masters is going great apparently, at least according to anyone who's not my mother. You can guess who's the reason for my constantly high stress levels.

So some context first maybe? Studying german philology with one semester left. Got the materials and written a bit over 20 pages out of the required 60. Writing itself is not the problem here, it's hard but it's still going forward.

The main problem are the constant fights with my mother about the subject of me writing that damn paper too slow and how she had it ready in january when she was studying and her thesis supervisor didn't need to correct anything in her work and let her finish that up next week after that.

So since July last year it's an argument at least once a month if not few times every week. it's killing any motivation I have to finish that damn thing and studies in general, but im one semester away so damn me if i don't drag myself to the finish line.

Does not help with my confidence with anything i wrote when my supervisor does not care about anything I and my group send her to check. I hate being home, or with my mother in general because it's just waiting untill she asks the question ""so how much have you written today/this week/whatever"" only for me to explode and immediatly try to retreat and her going on the offensive in response to me screaming.

it's drainig my mental health, and maybe physical too? i think my hairloss problem might be connected to the constant stress.

My English Prof gave me a 0 on a Textual Analysis Essay because she said it “Reads like AI”. I wrote the essay myself, I’m just not a very great (non-fiction) writer, unless I’m talking about something I really enjoy. I sent her my version history on Word and showed her the number of docs I used to write the essay (it ended up being 4 separate docs because of the rough drafts).

I don’t really know what to do, she said ‘If I’d like to contest my grade, she can sent it to Student Affairs‘, but is this really so necessary? With my version history and docs? This is the first essay I’ve written in easily a decade, too.

I showed my best friend a snippet of the essay (who’s also in college) and she just told me, and I quote, “Your sentences have a way of not ending correctly. You know how people have run on sentences? You have a habit of writing like you typed a run on sentence and then deleted have the sentence and added a period.”

This is just very frustrating. I have a lot going on and having to go to school court wasn’t really on my to-do list. I understand my essay wasn’t very good, but I didn’t think it was so bad that she would think AI wrote it. God forbid someone just be stupid I guess (half kidding).

Anyone have any advice for this? Pointers? I’ve never been to college and I’ve been out of school for nearly a decade. I’m not really sure how to navigate this whole situation.

Male, 23, attending a Cal State in California. Its class Expository Reading and Writing in Grades K-8. Its mainly about teaching, lesson planning, and expository reading. I emailed her during the semester for assistance on an assignment (this was an online class), but never got an email back. I then tried to call the number she provided on the syllabus three times, I even left a message but she never responded. I had a meeting with my school advisor over an unrelated issue but while I was with her I asked her if she could please reach out to the Professor for me. During our next session, the advisor told me she was not able to get a response from the Professor. To make matters worse, the Professor required that we submit all of our assignments at once the final week of the semester. This meant that we could not be graded throughout the semester or know if we were passing or failing the class. In the end, everyone in the class besides me and one other student received an A, while we received an F. I did every single assignment, followed each bit of instruction down to the word. 

She said she would not be posting grades, but if we wanted to receive our grade then to message her - which I did. I never heard back from her. This was during the Fall semester, I only discovered my grade in January via my transcripts. It was an F. I went back to some of my assignments to find comments on them. For one of my lesson plans I made myself and spent weeks making, she commented, ""Not your work sir."" When I asked her what that meant she meant and she responded on January 29th that there was a high likelihood that this was ""not my work,” but by then, she had already failed my course. By January 29, she .was going to check to see the likelihood and never got back to me. I feel she didn’t  
even know she hadn’t graded most or all of my assignments because she asked me what my grades were. To make matters worse only two of my assignments appeared as graded. SHe provided no proof of me plagiarizing.

We were asked to use ChatGPT on an assignment, a research paper using ChatGPT as the only source. She posted the link for ChatGPT on Google Classroom, she taught us how to use it and everything. I only used it for the required assignment she asked us to use it. Of course for that assignment she commented, ""You cannot use AI."" What the heck!? You told us to!? Again no proof of me cheating.

Today I had an appointment with her and OMBUS, my first time communicating with her live over a Zoom meeting.

We only had time to go over notes we had to submit, a video and script we were supposed to make, and commented on my lesson plan.  She claims my notes were accused of being unsatisfactory, even though the Professor provided no grading rubric or examples of what content the notes should contain, or how to format them (e.g., in complete sentences, in paragraphs, including our own perspectives or tying into how we resonate with the material, etc.). I took my notes in bullet point format, she claims I should have done it in paragraph format. The point of notes are that they are simple and concise for the student's understanding to refer to them throughout the semester, and again, no rubric or guidelines provided!

  
My video was accused of being low quality, low effort, thrown together with friends (subjective, but most likely I have no evidence to prove this statement false). My video was accused of not including historical photographs which could be used to present students an assignment regarding Bakersfield's past, as well as be used to form an expository text, assignment, or narrative that could be presented with students. My video did in fact include photographs, and my photos could indeed tie into Expository Writing, not to mention that this level of detail was not specified in the assignment. I even turned Share Screen on and showed the video to her and the OMBUS person. 

  
She also claimed I failed to include a script, though I did include a script. The instructions told us to include a script/transcript; the slash (/) implies to select one or the other (or so I assumed, but still stand by!), the instructions do not tell us to feature both, nor does it say to feature a script AND a transcript

  
The Professor never taught us how to make a script or a transcript in the first place. No grading rubric was provided for the final assignment and script, nor for any assignment in the class. The Professor mentioned that for the Midterm she never looked at anyone's midterms, she claimed she gave everyone an A regardless of their content, even if all they included was their name - I feel this violates the concept of fair grading and practice as a Professor, as any Professor could simply give any student or group of students an A or the opposite, an F on an assignment without even viewing it for themselves.

  
Then she began comparing my work to that of another student's, which felt unfair considering we were without a guideline rubric. Felt very unnecessary and rather condescending and unfair, especially when no rubric was provided to instruct otherwise, especially after what seemed like freedom with the assignment to do as we pleased. Again, the purpose of notes are that they written in a simple, concise manner for the sake of students being able to reread and analyze them for themselves, not to be structured in paragraphs and made for the Professor's reading pleasure unless specified otherwise.

   
Tldr and question: Professor accused me of plagiarism on two assignments without proof, claims I failed every assignment, even though I followed all her instructions and did everything, only to be rewarded with an F after the semester ended (she had us submit every assignment at once a few days prior to the end of the semester). I'm finally taking this up to a committee level.

I want to know what else I could and should do to prove her wrong, especially for the next step of going before a committee. Thanks in advance fellow Redditors!

326,Extremely frustrated with TA's this semester ,4,"They're in charge of the labs, and they're very fustrating this semester.

They don't respond to emails. They can't answer extremely simple yes/no questions and say to meet them during office hours for it. They assign the wrong assignments. They lose previous assignments. They constantly try to give lectures that are really just rambling. They rush people out of class way before it's even supposed to end.

My TA last semester was great. She gave us our work, briefly explained it, and would sit down and at least try to help if we needed it. I think my TA's this semester have been the source of 75% of my stress.",wt_anonymous
327,The Doctoral Process is A Mess! I Hate Revisions!,18,"I just successfully defended my dissertation and did all of the requested revisons, but I'm STILL getting requests to clarify what I did for my Chapter 4 analysis. I SUBMITTED CHAPTER 4 SEVERAL MONTHS AGO! It was approved which is why I was allowed to defend.

All of these request are either contradictions of previous revision requests, or something that's already been discussed. 

Granted they aren't trying to be malicious and genuinely care about my research, but at some point it has to end. There's a revision protocol for a reason. The goal is to finish, not win a Pulitzer! 

TL;DR - the doctoral process is highly inefficient & I hate it! ",ItsAllAGame_
328,tw: mentions of attempted SA- some guys in my criminal law class were being weird in regards to a potential SA case.....,27,"in my class yesterday we were learning about statutory rape cases (this is an undergrad criminal law class i just want to clarify) and we were reading this one case where a 14 year old girl pretended to be 16 and a 40 year old man was speaking to her and wanting to have a sexual relationship (they never met in person thank god) but the weird part was some of the questions a couple of the guys were asking (one of the guys was a devils advocate type guy and.... yeah) (also since its pledge week for the frats some of the guys were wearing suits so you could tell who was in a frat or not- most of them were in suits)

for those who are curious the case is state of minnesota vs mark moser (2016)

here are just a few that particularly stood out to me 

* hypothetically is it actually that bad to have a sexual conversation with a minor though? she told him she was 16! (he kept asking for nudes which would be asking for CP in both instances)
* but since they never met in person he should be off the hook right? its not like he actually did anything (he kept asking for nudes and were having sexual conversations)
* i mean yea its creepy or whatever but he never harmed her-- she should be punished for lying about her age right? (even tho age of consent in Minnesota is 16 it would still be considered statutory bc of the age gap)
* hypothetically if they were to have sex and then find out she was 14 what would happen? (we talked about this literally right before we started the case but the tone of voice was.... concerning)
* lets say, for example, i was talking to a minor but THEY turned the conversation to something sexual would i still get charged to speaking with them EVEN IF nothing happened???(my professor changed the topic after this bc holy shit someone actually call the cops)

(there were a lot more) i was sitting next to this one guy and said these questions were sus and he agreed-- it got to the point where my professor had to cut the conversation bc you could tell she was getting uncomfortable

tldr: theres a group of guys that made everyone in my class very uncomfortable because they were making *very* specific comments/questions about a SA case and make sure you listen closely bc they were exposing themselves ",jamie_with_a_g
329,Financial aid nightmare,5,"Background info: I am in a grad school program, it is 3 semesters long. In the first semester, you are considered a “credential” student, for the last semester you get switched to being a “graduate” student. I am in my last semester.

I will format this is a chronological way to hopefully make it easiest to follow.

Late November: Graduate status change application submitted (along with all of my other classmates)

December 12th: Last day of fall semester

January 12th: I received a grant for $7,000

January 18th: I looked at my student center for the first time before semester started and noticed the grant. I was ecstatic!!! $7k for free? Hell yeah.

However, given the name of the grant, it seemed to imply that it was for undergraduate students. So, before doing anything, I emailed the financial aid office and told them that I was wary about the grant possibly being given to me in error. They confirmed that it was not given in error and that I was entitled to the money. Amazing, I don’t have to worry about paying for my last semester.

January 22nd: I receive the refund checks, about $5k, essentially refunding me for a payment I made last semester and the loans I had taken out for spring, since the grant covered my tuition

January 23rd: I use 3k of my refund money to pay off most of the loans I took out for the semester

January 24th: Classes Start

February 7th: I received an email saying essentially “now that you are a graduate student, that grant no longer applies to you. It still applies for the fall semester, but you owe for the spring”. 

I am absolutely appalled, like what the actual fuck?? 

I email back saying essentially “um what the hell?”

She tells me that they submitted the graduate student change late, and they themselves said it would have consequences for their students. She also suggested I apply for a scholarship that has like a 20% acceptance, would give me half the money I had gotten anyways, and would require me to continue to work in the state I live for five years. Yeah, no thanks.

She said if I “wanted to talk to someone about the consequences this had for me, I should contact the financial aid office”. As she is from my subject’s department.

They also offer me a 10k loan to take out. Which is nice because at least it’s not like I’m stranded having to pay $6,600

February 8th: I send a fairly scathing (but polite) email to the financial aid office. Ending it with “I would like to know what will be done in order to resolve this issue”

February 9th: I receive an email back asking for my student ID number so that they can better assist me. I respond immediately with my ID.

February 15th: I send a follow up email, with the line “I would’ve hoped to hear back by now, given that this impacts my ability to pay my tuition”

February 16th: I receive an email back, from the SAME lady who emailed me in the first place. She essentially said “there’s nothing we can do for you, stop emailing”. That’s obviously not really what she said, but that was the underlying message.

February 19th: I accept the fact that nothing is really going to be done and accept the loan they offered me (at least I didn’t have to take all 10k, I could customize it to be the exact amount I owed)

February 21st: I check my account, loan hasn’t applied to my balance yet.

February 22nd: I check my account, loan still hasn’t applied to my balance yet

February 23rd: I check my account, loan still hasn’t applied to my balance yet.

I’m getting nervous, so I decide to call. Because now I have a past due balance of $6,600.

The person on the phone takes one look at my loan and says “oh yeah, so it looks like it’s stuck right now. Which is because this is a graduate school loan, and on your FAFSA you are still listed as a dependent, and you have to be an independent to get a grad school loan.”

Which is annoying, because if it was stuck, shouldn’t they tell me??? So that I can do what I need to. But whatever, I digress.

She then tells me that she’ll push it through to verification and that’ll take at least a week, and IF that goes smoothly it may be another week until the loan actually gets applied to my balance.

I ask her if there will be any consequences for paying late. She said “there are no late fees, and as of right now, they won’t drop you from your classes”.

So, essentially it feels like a fucking waiting game and who knows, maybe I’ll get dropped from my classes.

End of rant.

TLDR: school gave me a grant, because they were slow in putting in my graduate student status, it then got taken away 3 weeks into the semester. I am left fumbling to figure out a way to pay my tuition. Loan process gets stuck. Might get dropped from classes because of it.",UnableKaleidoscope58
330,im a little upset and i feel dumb ,6,"
so i’m a sophomore in college and don’t have anyone to live with next year. i also applied to be an ra but idk if i got selected yet. 

today someone contacted me about wanting to be in a roommate group for the best residence hall on campus but i decided to wait till tmr to text back just to think it over. my roommate got the same message and decided to text earlier. she knew i got the offer but i guess didn’t realize they were from the same person, i had told her like 30 mins before. 

i ended up texting them back and they said someone had contacted them so they weren’t looking anymore and my roommate felt bad but it seems to be fine 

part of me is upset and annoyed but at the same time, it’s not like she did it was any ill intent. any one could’ve texted before me but idk. like my roommate didn’t do anything wrong at all and i feel bad that she might think i’m mad at her. i’m not. i guess im just more upset at the situation. and jt feels weird bc i am party upset with her but i feel really fucking stupid being upset and i don’t really wanna be around her and i wanna be alone. 

part of me is also like ‘if i told you i got contacted by this group and you got the same offer why wouldn’t you check and see if it was the same person’ bc she said she didn’t want to take it away from me. she was also planning to get a single next year in a diff hall while i don’t know if my parents can afford that so i wasn’t. in this new one, everyone gets their own room and it’s apartment style w a kitchen, laundry, everything etc. 

it’s just ugh

I don't like the dining hall at my school. The food isn't good and things like pita and cookies are often very stale. No, pita is not supposed to snap instead of bend. But it gets worse. Multiple people have mentioned to me that they've gotten sick after eating the meat. Someone said she found a rock in her food one time. And yesterday, a cockroach fell from the ceiling in the eating area, which is way too close to all the food for comfort. I may just stop going to the dining hall at this point.

The professor wants the class to use a software not supported on Mac. He has changed the syllabus mid year from allowing the use of a Mac in his class to not allowing the use of a Mac in his class. Even though the professor reserves the right to change the syllabus at any time, making a change that could cost money regarding storage to emulate Windows, remote PC software, or buying a new laptop is beyond reasonable. We can sometimes barely afford to buy food outside a meal plan when we're hungry, and you expect us to consider getting a whole new laptop for your course. Not cool man.

336,"Feels like if you didn't find a friend *group* in the first 2 weeks of the year, you're fucked.",415,"Thanks for clicking to read, I love you.

**I want to start by saying I do indeed have friends.** Disparate friends from around my college that I hang out with occasionally. I know there are people here that struggle with finding even a single friend, and to those, PLEASE KEEP READING, I was in a similar spot, and I hope I can help you through sharing my experience.

So even though I do have friends, I have no friend group. That's due to the fact that my first few weeks here in uni were rough. I was an OOS student adjusting to a town I didn't know, was constantly busy shopping for things I needed, (I was out on my bike riding around alone when I wasn't in class) and had some mental hangups. I still needed to love myself for who I was, and constantly doubted anyone would care about my silly niche interests.

***It was before I learned the key to making friends isn't to be interesting, but to be interested in other people.***

I know that now, and I have zero problems making friends. I ask deep questions that really get a conversation going, listen carefully and let the other person do most of the talking. But alas, it feels like most people here cement into their friend groups during those first few weeks, when I was a hermit. And the funny part is, I DID have two orientation friend groups, TWO, but one stopped talking in the group insta chat, and seemed to split up into smaller sub-friend-groups. The other one stopped talking in the group text even though we did stuff for a week, my fault for not taking initiative and inviting people to do things that second week of school, I was still a shy, low self-esteem, poorly dressed fella.

And so, I got busy for a week, alone, and a week turned into three months, the loneliest 3 months of my life. So over winter break I spent literally the whole month reading books and watching videos on how to make friends.

So recently when I came back from winter break, I was determined to be social, and I was, I've been inviting people out to get food from time to time and have made new friendships here all by myself, without having to be introduced to them by someone I already know. Just by striking up a conversation in a social setting, and if it went well, I'd take em out to get lunch.

But not having a friend group where everyone knows each other is so damn hard because I NEVER get invited to do anything, I have to do all the inviting. I usually just invite someone to get lunch every now and then, but not having a group where everyone knows each other makes it so fucking exhausting man, and since I have to do all my socializing in different pieces, I can only dedicate so much time to each, rather than being able to combo it and form many deep friendships all at once. So, what do I do? I got over my self-esteem issues, I know all the rules of making friendships, dress well, treat people well, and take initiative to invite people to do things, but that doesn't change the fact that I was a hermit here during the time that mattered most, when friend groups were formed. Now I'm so socially isolated, lonely, exhausted from doing all the work, and haven't found ""my people"" what do I do?

I feel like it's a big ass ask to from a friend group where I'm the only mutual rn, everyone's already got one, and it would be much easier to inject myself into a pre-existing one. I'm just not sure what the best path forwards is for me.",TheFinalZebra

339,I'm starting to suspect that my Professor writes fake RPM reviews,61,"Context is that my professor is the professor for Discrete Math. Her class is notorious for being horrible, but since she's the only professor I had no choice. I tried to keep an open mind that maybe she is just bad at teaching, and a bit harsh on grading. I didn't score very well but I was always around 20% above the average, so I'm doing alright. She punished you for guessing and there was no MCQ, because she said that you don't really understand it if you guess. Okay, that's harsh but fair enough.

However, she seems to be extremely paranoid about cheating. For homework, you could either submit solo or do it with a partner, she straight up said that those who do partner, if both partners submit, they will be subject to violation of Academic Integrity, because the two papers are technically identical so it's technically cheating. (even though she literally allowed them to work together) Luckily, I did mine solo. 

She also made us fill out a survey that I swore was trying to get us into ""admitting"" we cheat. The survey kept asking if you use ChatGPT, blab blah blah, did you use chegg. Obviously, I answered no, because well, I really didn't, but imagine if someone answered yes, they would've been banished to the shadow realms. 

Also apparently, she heard that someone was using their phone during a quiz (no proof someone was), and she straight up threatened to give us all zeros. Good thing that didn't go through because I studied my ass off for it, and got a 90 on that quiz.

Welp, last class, she tried to coerce people into admitting they cheated on their code. (There was a homework that required you to write C++ code for prime numbers and stuff). I swore she's trying to gaslight people into ""Admitting"" that they cheated even though they didn't. She says that if she THINKS you cheated, she will give you a zero and yknow the academic integrity thing. Apparently, she was freaking out about codes that have as little as 3% match, but there's only so many ways you can sort prime numbers, like bruh, there's bound to be some similarities. I know I did all the code myself, so if I do get written down, I'm gonna fight it, but it's absolutely inane that she goes to such great lengths for this type of shit. 

So onto the RPM thing. My friends in the class have decided to report her because of her ludicrous behaviors, and apparently she has been reported in the past too, but then she would always huge curve to save her job (which is comforting news because I'd probably get an A). I decided to check on her reviews, and realized that all the 5 star reviews sounded too professional, too weird, and had inconsistencies. One of them said that ""said"" student had her for X class, but this X class, last time she taught it was like 3 or 4 years ago, nobody just suddenly decides to leave a review after they already graduated for a class they took 4 years ago. Most of the reviews are along the lines of ""most people fail because they don't lsiten"" ""they have the audacity to leave bad reviews because they do horrible"" ""i once had office hours with her till 11pm"" Please, no one is staying till 11pm. ""She gives due date extensions and lots of hints."" Hell nah she doesn't. Her TA office hours are amazing but like her actual office hours are really not that great. Other reviews are like ""if you wanan pass this class without using ur brain then drop this class"" ""shes a gem"" ""she's great she's amazing"" Like it's possible some of them 5 star reviews are students, but I find it hard to believe now. Showed it to my friends and they seemed to agree too. All the 5 star reviews have perfect grammar and punctuations while the real student reviews are filled with crappy english spelling and slangs. All the negative reviews have like at least 3 thumbs down, which I bet is her inflating it, and she reports the negative reviews as well. It's worth noting that she is AWARE of her rating on RPM, because she acknowledged it during first day of class.

My god, it hasn't affected me yet, but her pettiness is really making me dislike her. ",Independent_Peace144

341,I can't do this anymore,91,"I started college immediately out of high school at 18 (I'll be 24 in March) and I was set to graduate this semester. Did the application and everything. 

My advisor emails me at the start of the semester to inform me that I will actually not be graduating this semester because I basically failed two classes that are a requirement for my degree. I was already at the point of giving up and that email just sent me into a spiral. 

Every time I think about what to do, I cry. I can't talk about how school is going with anyone without crying.

I noticed the high bar at the start of the quarter so I figured it wouldn’t be hard, but the grading is pretty strict and there are no re-dos. There are a bunch of assignments, weekly quizzes, and two finals (exam+paper) and the class has no extra credit opportunities.

I’m currently at a 94.8% in the class, and if I want a 4.0 then I would need to get 100% on the final paper, the final exam, and all the other assignments due until then. 

Honestly the class is fun, and the work isn’t bad, but man it’s so pretentious to have a 4.0 be a 97% in a class structured like this. A 4.0 should represent  great performance in a class, but expecting it to be near perfection is ridiculous.

343,College was supposed to be a fresh start,316,"I had such a low gpa in highschool due to basically failing a year. The only reason I passed with the lowest scores possible was due to the fact that my highschool wasn't failing anyone during quarantine. Even tho I was an A/B average student my other 3 years I still only had a 2.26 gpa.

I went to community college to try and get a fresh start and in my first semester last year I failed two classes with a D. Now my gpa is a 2.14 and I really want to do this psi beta club thing my community college does but I need a 3.25 gpa. Even if I get straight As this semester, I'd only be at a 3.10 gpa, and I can't even garuntee straight As this semester. To raise it even more to qualify, I'd need basically straight As again next semester too. 

And by that point i'd be my third semester and basically be done there so it feels pointless trying to raise it. College was supposed to be a fresh start but my advisor put me in two of the most challenging classes I'd ever been in, with professors who half the time didn't follow my ADA accomodations(yes i reported them, ADA office said there was nothing they could do). So of course I got Ds, but I was delusional and thought I'd be able to get at least Cs so I wouldn't have to drop any classes. Since my mom would kill me if i had to go to community longer than 2 years because thats the normal amount of time, aka what I need to do too. So I couldn't drop the classes and now my entire gpa is fucked just like highschool and it feels pointless.

But i can't drop out because the only way to do what I want is degrees and I physically cannot see myself doing anything else. Other than slowly rotting on a sidewalk doing nothing with my life cause I failed so miserably and have no life or job or money or anything.

But i dont want that to happen cause my mom said that'd happen to me when I was 14 and I can't prove her right.  Especially not 5 years later!

I don't know how to fix my gpa faster cause there's no way to. I can't even garuntee I'll be able to get straight As this semester. And I really thought college would be a new better start but it's not.

345,concerning behavior from friend…,5,"Hi everyone! So over this past week one of my friends has been expressing some concerning behavior. 

I know he struggles a lot with his mental health and I totally understand that. This past week however, it seems to have escalated. 

He’s told me that he’s pretty sure he wants to drop out after this semester and has already canceled housing.

Hes struggled a bit academically (mostly just getting motivated) and has diagnosed ADHD. However that’s not the primary reason for wanting to leave. It seems like the catalyst has been the housing situation (campus shortage of rooms) and the possibility of having a roommate next semester, as he is in a private room currently. 

Although I think this reasoning is a little odd, ive been supportive. However now, it seems like he’s spiraling. 

If he drops out there will be nowhere for him to live as he doesn’t have a job and cannot move back with his family since they found out he is gay. He’s essentially fucked himself over. 

I’ve tried to provide suggestions (like talking with disability services about room accommodations since he has documentation for health issues) but it doesn’t seem like he’s willing to take advice. (perhaps self sabotage?)

He’s also been posting a lot on private stories about wanting to d*e and feeling like he has no purpose. 

I’ve been talking to him everyday and now it’s to the point im considering anonymously reporting him to our school’s counseling center. My concern is that because I’m the only person talking to him about this, he’ll realize it’s me and this could cause him to spiral worse. I just don’t know what to do. Any advice is welcome.

I only applied to a few schools and so far haven’t got into any. What would be my next steps if I don’t get accepted to any of the transfers?

347,I feel like nobody understands ,46,"I'm in my last semester of undergrad and my mental health is rapidly deteriorating. I'm trying to get into grad school for a Nutrition program. I'm taking 16 credit hours, all senior upper level classes, and 2 of my classes are Organic Chemistry lecture and lab. I felt like I was somewhat grasping the content at first and I made a C on the first exam. But ever since then I've been completely lost on the material and between commuting to class 2 days a week (45 minutes one way), I feel like nobody understands when I say I have no time and it's depressing me.

Like, Mondays are the one day I have to try and do self care and meal prep. Tuesdays and Thursdays (my Organic chemistry class days) I'm up at 5:30am to get ready and I don't get home until sometimes 8 or 9pm at night. Wednesdays I'm busy all day working on material from Tuesday's Organic chemistry class that's due before my Thursday class. I have go to bed at like 8 or 9pm on Mondays and Wednesdays just so I can get enough rest to feel like I can drive safely (I have insomnia and I wake up a lot during the night). 

Fridays I have a service learning class which is basically like a 60 hour internship. So I really only have time to do assignments for my other 4 classes on part of the day Friday and Saturday. Sundays I spend doing more Organic Chemistry stuff, and for what? I feel like none of the information is sticking. 

I'm doing the bare minimum in all my other classes and I still barely have time to do it all. Every time I try to reach out to someone for support, they're always like ""you got this, you're gonna be just fine"" etc etc. I lnow they're just trying to be positive but no, I don't have this. I don't know if I'm going to be fine. I wish just once someone would validate how I'm feeling. I tried to talk to one of my instructors today who has been somewhat of a mentor for me and when I told her everything that was on my plate she was like ""well this is how it's gonna be when you're working a real job"",  referring to waking up super early and whatnot. Which I already know because I'm a 37 year old non-traditional student and I've worked plenty of jobs. But the thing with jobs is that you get to come home and your evening is yours. You don't have to do assignments. And I said this to my instructor during the same conversation and she was just like ""no it's not, the work never really stops when you work in academia"". Thank fuck I'm not planning on working in academia then because it sounds like I would be setting myself up for a life of misery and depression. 

I don't know. I'm beginning to wonder if maybe there's just something wrong with me and maybe I'm just not cut out for this.

Also in case anyone asks, I've already set up counseling appointments with my school to start next week.

348,Has anyone else ever been given an assignment that just sparks dread?,29,"I need to vent a bit and maybe hear if anyone else has had any bullshit assignments that they have felt this way about:

I’m graduating this semester with a STEM degree and before now I’ve never had any assignments that induced anxiety like this before. 

This one bullshit “interdisciplinary studies” requirement that had about 10 different options to choose from to fill, but only one was available this semester: Mediation.

 It’s literally only 8 weeks long and its online so its almost done. The teachers (yes, there are 2 for some reason) have made most of the assignments easy enough with discussion posts and short papers due each week.

One of the last assignments of the semester is for each of us to make a video that needs to be posted to Youtube. It has to be 15 minutes long of me role playing as a mediator and I’m supposed to get 2 other people to volunteer to be the conflicted parties. It is so embarrassing thinking of even asking someone to be in this video let alone acting with them. I don’t know anyone in this class and I barely know anyone at my school since I transferred here last year from another university. All of my friends live in different states.

I’ve never felt this way about an assignment before, but every cell in my body is absolutely dreading it. Like it is such a stupid assignment. I am a terrible actor and I am so awkward when it’s just me making a video of me talking. 

They could have asked me to write a script and it would be more than sufficient to get the point across that I understand the methods that were taught. Let me write a huge paper, literally anything except make a 15 minute video of myself acting in front of people.

I also know you can make videos private on YouTube, but I am a VERY private person on social media and I hate the idea of having a video of myself uploaded at all. It completely weirds me out.

TLDR: I am dreading having to complete this assignment that I don’t feel is necessary for the type of class it is. Tell me about your bullshit assignments that made you feel this way.",sarcasticb

350,I denied UC Berkeley ,7,"Hey guys.

Rather than going to a university straight out of HS, I went to a community College first. I was a complete failure in HS and had D's and C's, no extracurriculars, etc. I was not a competitive student by any means, which is why I decided to go to a community College. At CC I worked my ass off and got into a ton of programs, extra curriculars, the honors program, the honors society, made my own club, was part of the student government, maintained a very high GPA, etc. I got accepted into UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Riverside, UC Santa Cruz, and yes..UC Berkeley. I also got into Chapman University. 

I chose Chapman. And I regret it everyday. Here's why I chose it though. It's close to home, I was under the impression that the program I was entering was the best, and its been a school I've been aiming toward since Jr year of high school (but idk why it's been one of my top choices tbh). I didn't choose Berkeley or the other UCs because their programs weren't as good comparatively speaking, and I didn't want to move out and live in ratchet dorms and deal with that. I thought I made the right decision.

Unfortunately, I absolutely hate Chapman. I feel like I'm paying an enormous amount of money for a half assed program, and they're even trying to make me stay an additional year, which I literally cannot afford and have no reason to do. They just want to make money off of me. I want to think that whats best for me will always meet me in the way of life, and that even though it's tough there must be a reason I'm here, but right now, I'm just kicking myself over denying one of the top schools in the country. I don't think I would have necessarily enjoyed Berkeley, but the name itself, the prestige, its ranking and its education are so amazing that I feel so disappointed and upset with myself for denying them. I'm already almost a year into Chapman, and I've hated almost every moment. But I feel like I'm I'm too deep, would hate going through the reapplication process, etc. 🥲this is kind of just a vent.",Laleskalamales
351,You know your college is lacking behind when all the students know it’s very disorganized. ,5,"I’m in a group project and the subject came up after our initial meeting as “hey how’s college life going how do you like the college?” 

All 4 of us agreed the college we attend has been very disorganized and lacking unlike other colleges in the state. 

I have a feeling our college may not last long and may shut its doors down the road if the place is this disorganized (plus they already laid off 25 admin members) The professors we all get we usually see them once and then they disappear. Some came from other colleges and are there just as “fill ins”, others are still at the place but they just suck. Out of all the professors about 75% of them for the last 2 years I don’t see any classes from them or ever hear from again. 

Many years ago when my cousins attended this college they had wonderful experiences and got degrees there but now it’s really lacking in staying out there. They had a drop in college students over the last several years and covid especially hit them hard. This is not a private college either this is a public university. I almost debated about switching colleges but I decided since I’m a senior here now I’m unable to switch over. 

Im not fully sure why the college is lacking so much but I have so much bad experiences right now with it that I’m just wanting to be done sooner rather than later but I still got about another year left. I’m hoping the college makes its till then but I have my doubts at this point. ",LovableButterfly

Maybe they are. I don’t even know, because they’re so lazy and disengaged I can’t even tell what they actually know or understand.  
Is everyone at a state school just there because mom and dad said so? Does anyone actually give a shit? Is all I have to look forward to for the next several years:

-peer reviews where I get back only an “everything is good” and I have to attempt to review their bulleted list because they didn’t bother actually writing the paper?  
-group projects where my teammates refuse to  do anything?  
-professors asking questions to the sound of crickets until I raise my hand to answer so that it’s not awkward?  
-having to have lectures stopped during class so that professors can remind students to stop texting, or that poor attendance will hurt their grade, or that participation is part of their grade?

When I graduated with high honors, I was sad to leave but excited to be able to get my graduate degree at a more prestigious school (that costs significantly more). I thought my Master's would be worth it (as in loans) considering location, reputation, and ""connections.""

Realizing that this is the ultimate scam and that despite grad school being advertised as an opportunity for upward social mobility, it feels like it's just another way for wealthy people to reaffirm their status. The upper class is willing to pay for it just for the name, but the lower class has to feel guilt and shame for investing in a poor education.

So I really thought I was in the clear and that if I reviewed, and practiced, and studied hard enough I could force myself through the next course, too.

Maybe my mistake was not letting my life completely revolve around the course until about halfway the semester? But that wasn’t exactly sustainable, either. I still have not mentally recovered from that class, and I’m not sure I’m going to. I thought everything would be okay once the semester ended, but the anxiety from that class just spilled over into all my other classes, even the ones I should enjoy, and I feel like I’m barely functioning as a student.

One group is doing rodeo/cowboy culture in the American West. Another did Native American cultural burns/ancestral ceremonies. But my group picked... beauty pageants. And only because the director was in one as a child.

I picked anthropology so I could feel like Indiana Jones - not to watch young women get exploited in boring 3-hour long shows. I'm still going to put all my effort in for the sake of being a good student, but I'm a little disappointed with the topic, especially since this class is a once in a lifetime opportunity.

So, in my online music appreciation class, the  midterm, which I just took, had a listening section which didn't work at all on my computer for some reason. Fortunately, or so I thought, there was an alternative to the listening portion listed separately from the rest of the exam which was specifically for people experiencing technical difficulties. But I clicked on it, and it was literally just the exact same stuff as on the main exam, so of course it still didn't work at all. WTF? Did she just irrationally assume that everyone who experienced technical difficulties would figure out how to deal with them eventually? The thing is, when it comes to stuff like this, professors always say ""You're an adult, figure it out"", but I don't really think that applies when it comes to stuff that the average adult wouldn't necessarily know how to do, like fix random technical errors on a website which uses a very specific system.

362,bad algebra teacher? ,3,"I'm a 23 year old freshman, 1 month into college so far, its online, and I'm taking 4 classes. all of them are great besides my algebra class, if you can call it that.. 

my teacher hasn't done a single lecture, video lesson, or even reading in our textbook. we're about to take out 2nd exam, and I got a 17% on the last one, because we aren't allowed to use notes for formulas or anything, so i misremembered the formulas and while i had the numbers correct, the order was wrong, making my answers also wrong. his median on the last test was a 60% for the class. 

when you mention hey why haven't we done any lessons he just says ""you should already know this, this is review"" okay then why the hell am I taking this If I should already know it? he uses webwork to assign stuff and grade it, and there's an email professor option at the bottom, I needed help so I hit that and submitted my question. he never answered. when I asked about it again on canvas he said ""I don't check those"" and has also just been blatantly incorrect on answers to problems but the system will mark as wrong, and he doesn't check them.. so it's just marked as incorrect even though it's not. 

I asked my advisor to switch but she said there's no other math classes with openings now, and it'll mess up my financial aid to drop below full time. with 65% of the grade being our final exam, I think if I can do half decent enough on that I can pass the class, but am I screwed?

So, my university offers an entirely online MBA program, which I’ve nearly completed. I only have a few classes left, and should graduate by Christmas. Unfortunately, I’ve found that the professors who teach the online courses appear to only update their lectures every year or two. 

One of my courses this semester is taught by a professor I had earlier in my program. He requires a two page essay with every exam, about which I have no complaint. However, what I do take issue with is that the essay topic for exam two, which is due this week. The scenario is that you have just been promoted to marketing research manager for Vyera Pharmaceuticals, formerly Turing Pharmaceuticals, which was founded by “Pharma Bro” Martin Shkreli. Your task is to identify market segments which have both favorable and unfavorable opinions of the company.

First of all, f*** that guy. I hope that smug little troll gets everything that’s coming to him, and I wouldn’t *want* to be promoted to *any* position within his company, even if he’s no longer involved. However, this assignment does not give me that option, and the course material the professor wants us to use to solve this problem comes from an article that he co-authored in 2004.

That said, I told my wife that I don’t know how I’m going to write this essay without saying, “F*** Martin Shkreli” at least half a dozen times. The essay itself is 25 points of a 125 point exam, and part of me wants to justify not doing it by citing that Vyera filed for bankruptcy in May 2023, and therefore saving their public image is moot.

I know that my feelings about Shkreli and my desire to not complete this assignment are unprofessional at best, but the *very least* the professor could have done was pick a more relevant example. To be clear, **I am going to do the assignment**. I am merely expressing my opinions and venting in a public forum. Opinions?

Edit: Again, as I stated in my last paragraph, I understand that the professor is trying to get us to apply concepts from course material to a real world scenario. I will complete the assignment and attempt to detach my opinions from it to the best of my ability. And that I am simply venting in a public forum, as dumb as it may sound. *I have seen many other people vent about even dumber things than this*.",NotATroll1234

But we got to keep it when the course was done. We could share with other students. We could buy used, borrow, and resell. Now students pay $150 and get to keep nothing. Even the physical options are loose-leaf and worthless without the code.

I have switched to OpenStax. It has been a ton of work. But now my students pay nothing. Or they can pay $45 for a hardcover that has the material for multiple courses and can be resold. I know the price in workload. I know that office support has been taken away by administration. Nobody will help you make exams, slides, etc anymore. And content expectations are through the roof: lecture videos, accessibility, notes, guides, etc, etc.

I regret nothing. It was worth it. How many students do you teach per year? 200? 500? At $150 a pop, that's five figure sums every year. It's time to put that money back in the pockets of our students.",

371,How Screwed am I really?,8," 

Every day, all over Reddit/YouTube, everyone is talking about how saturated the Computer Science/Tech market is how companies are chopping the low-hanging fruit, and how AI is speeding things up and such. I'm in the end of my junior year in CS (actually not even CS it's called computing in the arts and is basically CS but replacing the math with art classes lol).

And personally, I feel completely fucked Im going up against people who have been coding since high school and I barely knew what code was. In my defense I feel that I've come a long way in the year and a half or so I've been learning to code through school considering I didn't know a lick before but, I am not far enough. I'm overwhelmed by all that I don't know, every time I try to learn stuff outside of classes I get frustrated and overwhelmed and it falls apart. I like coding its just very overwhelming sometimes. I've never been good at math and I always wanted to do something creative, I wanted to work in game development but changed my mind when I saw how toxic the work/life balance is on that end of the industry.

I have been applying to internships, but all I have gotten is rejection after rejection because I don't have the skills or relevant experience. And I have failed every time I have tried to gain that experience.

But all this is beside the point. What is the reality? I'm sure that is not as doom and gloom as it is being painted as but, at the same time its going to be much much harder. I don't see how I can compete because I don't think I have the drive to force myself to make the sacrifices and do the hard work that will be necessary. I don't want to give up video games/any other hobby forever and replace it with coding or grind 25+ hrs a week on leetcode/personal projects like I've heard some say.

I am getting sidetracked again but, what is the reality with the industry? What is it really going to take for anyone to break into the industry in this day and age all things considered?

He assigns 20-75 questions and the quiz has 5 so we don't know which 5. The problem is, he never goes over those questions in class. I can read that book one hundred times and I won't understand the equation to know how much product is produced if we use the entire limiting reagent. The book gives the question and the answer, not the in between. 

Needless to say we all failed that quiz. I got a 40%, my friend got a 15%, the girls next to me and my lab partner also didn't do well. The average class grade was a failing grade. But he referred everyone who failed into tutoring. My guy, if multiple people are failing your lecture (who are attending every lecture) then we might not be the problem.

Some ridiculous experiences I have had: 

\- 4 person project to write a manifesto with an optional digital aid. I was the only person who did any writing on the manifesto, and one of my group members messaged me ten minutes before class asking if I made a slideshow. When I told them no, she said ""well can you make one?'. Uh, no I cannot. It isn't required, and if you want one so bad make it yourself. Which is exactly what I told her.

\- 5-7 person year long project. Was a big service and research project that was part of a community immersion course, which means our work was to benefit a real local nonprofit in real time. Included a professional presentation in front of the board of the local nonprofit, as well as a presentation and an Immersive Learning showcase. Everyone in my group dropped the class after first semester, meaning I had to do the entire thing alone. 

\- 3 person class takeover project. Group was supposed to teach the class a concept from the unit for 35-45 minutes. Informed of this and grouped up at beginning of semester. One of the group members stopped communicating a week before it and didn't show up on presentation day. We had to fill her speaking time.

There is more, but those three were back to back and really just left a bad taste in my mouth. ",Zealousideal_Try2334

A specific member of the group was just floating, he'd let others do his job and  would only complain during our filming process. He was assigned to be a producer and he was supposed to record audio. He did a poor job by not even putting effort into this project. While the rest was doing 120% he wasn't even doing 30%. He'd sit around and neglect his tasks, leave early and over all wouldn't be productive. 

Now we're having a talk with him tomorrow, most people's opinion have changed over the course of this group assignment. Leading to us no longer wanting to interact with him. Whenever we do interact with him it would ruin our mood. But now alot of people are back paddling their opinions leading to the most uncomfortable situation. 

Now I will voice my opinion of what happened. But what would you do after this is over? I will interact with him if I have to but I wouldn't voluntarily work with him again and even if I was forced into a group with him I'd beg to swap.

I’m in my first year of college and have all As and academically am really good. But, there’s one 5 credit course that’s taking the absolute life out of me, intro Zoology. It’s the most dropped course at my college and I wouldn’t take it if it weren’t for it being required to transfer- though it has nothing to do with my degree. I have a C in the class and am barely scraping by and it’s making me really depressed. I spend the vast majority of my study time on that class and still can’t manage a B. There’s no graded homework in the class so we’re judged solely based off of exams and lab practicals. 

I don’t really have many friends so academics feels like the one thing I have going for me, and now that I’m not doing well I feel really worthless. I am going to try and bring my grade up but I feel really stuck. Life’s been hard recently with my family dog at the end of his ropes, gma having cancer, financials, personal medical issues, and having to come off of Zoloft (because of medical issues) so it’s making me depressed and somtimes just unable to get out of bed. I have a therapist and that helps, but I can’t get a new depression/anxiety med because I don’t have health insurance.

I’m worried that having all As and one C will make me a bad student, and while I know that’s untrue, it’s hard to not get wrapped up in it. I want to go to graduate school someday and my anxiety is convincing me that zoology will take that away from me.",prettygibby

I have a lot of student loans and am in grad school (probably a bad idea, but that’s a separate rant). Well, I was notified recently of getting a scholarship - yay, right? So, I go to check my financial aid, and - lo and behold - my school reduced my institutional grant aid by the exact amount of the scholarship. To top it off, I am now being asking for a thank you letter for said scholarship - for money I will not see and which will not make a difference in my life or debtload. I see zero of that money and still have to take the same amount of loans. Does this donor even know that their money is going straight into the school’s pocket and not helping anyone?

It was pretty depressing to get excited about a bit of extra money and then have it essentially go into the ether.

385,"Rant…sorry…regretting major in biology, supposed to go to medschool, like computer science, want to move on…",10,"
Ah, just feel like a total failure, always self sabotaging. I graduated with a BA in biology (3.76 GPA) from a d3 school, am pre-med, and just want to find a job already. Didn’t take it seriously and kinda coasted/chatGPT’d my way through it. Not sure why I chose it, just wanted to get it done with since I already had some courses for it done. About 20k in debt. Parents and siblings are willing to pay it but I just feel so guilty. Wish I did computer science but I was scared it would be too difficult to do with pre-med, and kept getting pushback to stick with medicine. angry at myself and my mental health is terrible. I feel like disappearing a lot of the time and want to give my parents money, not take it away from them. 

Five of my six siblings are doctors and they help out financially, but I just don’t have that drive, can not focus on studying and don’t even really have a passion for biology, was just told to do it for medschool/MCAT, but the loans and many years of schooling scare me. I have the choice to go back to Pakistan for medschool since the barrier to entry is lower and there’s virtually no loans, but I’ll feel like a failure then, even though it’s how my siblings did it. I wish I could rekindle my interest in it, I do think being a doctor is cool and have been exposed to nothing else, except computer science which I was good at in high school and felt like it was purposeful, but the math and advanced stuff would scare me and I just dropped out of it my sophomore year, thinking it would kill my GPA to do it with PreMed, but I regret it now. Wanted to transfer out to a better school but waited too long and didn’t work hard at it, and was in another country at the time. My mind was on autopilot and I just did biology, and was quite depressed throughout. 

I’m pretty much suicidal everyday, since I had great prospects as a child and was expected to be some kind a genius doctor, but never fell in love with it, and I just fell out of love with studying science. Scared of the MCAT too and applying to medschool since I don’t think my resume is good enough, and even if I do get in, im scared of all the training and more stress of being a doctor. I guess I can see myself being a doctor in the future, but I just want to make good money now in my gap year, and am trying to integrate CS however I can, but am debating whether another entire degree is worth it. My siblings love being doctors though and urge me to do the same, even though they did it the easy way outside of the USA, did their USMLE and matched over.

I wish I was financially independent already and was helping my parents out by being in CS which I think I can do well in. Also trying to work up the nerve to apply to medical school but the whole process is so daunting. I procrastinate so much and then just make an impulsive decision and dig myself deeper into trouble, and regret the past. I’m not sure what is mentally wrong with me, may be from my childhood trauma/abuse that I avoid talking about. 

I’m trying to let bygones be bygones and my parents are sad seeing me so miserable and telling me it’s alright and to do what I want now, but having 5 doctor siblings and being considered the gifted kid really ruined me, im lazy, lack focus and didn’t do research on what to do after college or how to apply to college until last minute, and I accept the blame for distracting myself and lying to myself. trying to look forward and see how I can do a computer science degree in the shortest and least costly way possible. Been doing freecodecamp and cs50 which sparked my interest in the field again, but it just makes me jaded that I didn’t plan out what I wanted to do and assert myself sooner. 

I just don’t want to let my parents and family down ever, yet I’m doing just that by being so confused all the time. I really need to get my ADHD diagnosed and treated, I just feel like a zombie with no motivation and am always catastrophizing or daydreaming or aaahhh. I find it very hard to stay motivated and am constantly depressed, then suddenly my mood shifts and I don’t really care about how messed up I made my life. I make very impulsive decisions, for instance, tried to become a personal trainer but got sick and lost touch with the gym and lost motivation hearing how hard it is when starting out. I’m not sure why but I stop when things get tough, I didn’t used to be like this…

386,I love my classes but I feel like I can never try hard enough,20,"I’m a sophomore right now… honestly I’m not sure how I’ve gotten this far. I went through a lot during my childhood and now I have mental health issues that make the most basic tasks really really hard. Yesterday after class it took me 4 hours to make Mac n cheese. And not even the real kind, the boxed kind! I’m still proud of myself for eating though, because I used to just give up. 

This sort of thing makes getting assignments done very hard, but I still manage, sort of. Sometimes I think about dropping out, but I don’t want to. I feel so genuinely lucky to get to be in college at all, and I love my major. And of course this makes it hurt even worse when I do badly at subjects I like. I do all the readings and I try my best to really engage with the material even when I don’t have to, and I try really hard on every assignment, so I do well on tests, but I cannot. fucking. deal with the volume of assignments that some of my classes have, because everything takes me like double time. I know I should be going out and getting internships and a real job and everything right now also but it all feels so hard. 

But it’s not even the academic part of college that feels the worst, it’s the social part. I was very isolated most of my teenage years and I genuinely have no idea how to behave in a Real Academic Environment. Sometimes I go on this subreddit and r/askprofessors just to read posts about annoying types of students… I always find at least one post about the type of person I am. I’m very anxious in class if I can’t do something with my hands so I draw the entire time. I ask for weird accommodations and I often turn things in late or last minute. I used to probably talk too many times in class until I read that you should only ever speak 2 times per class so now I do that (mostly). It’s difficult for me to tell how big of a deal all this is, so I avoid talking to my professors because I always think they probably really hate me. Sometimes they like me though and this is even more confusing. I had a professor last semester who noticed that I stopped saying much in discussions, and I explained that I didn’t want to talk too much, so I was only talking twice per class and keeping it as short as possible when I did talk, and he said that he genuinely missed my contributions, which kind of threw a wrench in this whole thing. 

I always feel like there’s something everyone else knows but me, and it’s all my fault for not trying hard enough to understand it. People on this subreddit always say college is really easy if you just apply yourself, and college students are actually getting dumber year by year. I’m the dumb student you’re talking about… I’m sorry.

387,Being Laughed at In Discussion,171,"So, I was laughed at in discussion for giving a wrong answer to a very simple question in Chem 106. I tried to explain my reasoning that I just misunderstood the question. It was just really hurtful to be laughed at by a group of people. I feel like we are here to learn together and mocking someone is counterproductive to the group’s goal of learning. I am thinking that if I see people laughing at anyone else, I am going to call them out and tell them to stop. The professor didn’t in this case, which makes me think she won’t in the future. I think it is very inappropriate to laugh at anyone in learning environment. 

For context, I am one of the people that answers questions a lot in class, but there are others, too. The thing is, no one else has been laughed at for giving a wrong answer. I’m not sure if I am doing something to make people feel like laughing at me is the proper response. I’ve thought about going to the professor, too. I’m pretty sure she likes me, because she has offered me a role to be part of this research team this summer and will just chit chat with me in lab. After class though, she seemed a bit cold to me. I’m thinking about going to her office hours to bring up how it made me feel and how negative I think it is to the environment.

Any advice is welcome.

So I am 23 and am technically a second semester sophomore. I am autistic and have a really hard time making friends because I’m not super social. Anyways since I transferred this semester, I’m at a brand new school and know nobody. The second night I was here, my RA asked to speak to me in the hallway to get to know me. We ended up talking for like 3 hours and we had a lot in common. We sometimes have conversations when we run into each other in the building. I had an issue last weekend and she gave me her phone number to communicate with her about it because it was easier than email. Anyways, it kinda seemed like we were maybe becoming friends? My therapist has been challenging me to ask her or another person to get lunch (to encourage me to be social and make friends) and I kept telling her I was scared to ask my RA to get lunch because of the possibility of being told no and feeling embarrassed about asking. I am always afraid to ask people to hang out because of my fear of rejection. But I was going to do it. The other day I decided to request her on instagram because if she accepted it would make me feel more confident to ask her to hang out, but my request was just sitting there for a couple days until I just now realized she declined me. I feel embarrassed and stupid and like a dumbass for even thinking that I possibly made a friend. I’m definitely not asking now.

I guess my question is: is it normal for an RA to do this? Why would she talk to me for so long and give her number but decline me on instagram? Does it mean she doesn’t like me (as a friend)?

right now my grades are fine, but my burnout has gotten to the point where all i want to do is sleep bro. the past 2 days i haven’t been able to get out of bed to eat or get ready or go to class. howwwww do i even begin to deal with this burnout so i can function like a semi-regular person again? if someone could please give me advice i would be so eternally grateful 🥲",Dangerous_Buddy_6351
397,Does anyone feel like they went into college/uni too early?,29,"I’m 21 and possibly graduating next semester. I’m majoring in something I don’t like anymore, gonna be in ton of debt, and not enough pay to sustain myself initially.

And I think this all stems from, there’s too much pressure on high school students to go into college straight after high school. Hell, that it’s the only way to be successful, I wish I didn’t listen.

I’m just now my passion is language learning and I want to teach ESL to Spanish speakers, that doesn’t require a degree in much places. I mean, it helps but I could’ve gotten a Spanish degree instead of history. It’s too late to change my major, I only have one more history course and I’m taking it this semester.

I don’t know, maybe if I was older as well I would have better discipline, more mature, better experience, studying would’ve been easier perhaps.",IdontKnowAHHHH

399,My professors assignment policy is frustrating,0,"My professor is refusing to put any sort of resources or ways to turn in work online. We had a paper due yesterday, and I can admit that this is my fault, I had it written out in word, and was hoping he would put a place online to turn it in. There are 12 people in the class, 3 people ended up having it ready, because we all wrote it online. He said we discussed that all papers are to be turned in on paper (we never did), but I checked the syllabus, and unfortunately it does say so on there.

I'm just frustrated because I keep up with what teachers say and I keep up with my work, and got a 3.95 last semester, and I'm just disappointed that I'm in all likelihood going to get a zero (syllabus says no late work) on this paper because of a goofy policy, that I should have read, I admit it, but it still irks me, especially since 75% of the class had the same question.

One more thing that's unrelated to this, we asked why he wouldn't put any resources or anything at all on blackboard, and he said ""I don't put things online because some people think they are clever and will do all the work without ever showing up to class."" His argument is incredibly invalid because every other professor uses online resources, and wouldn't you know, classes are full every time. ",chilidig
400,"wish i could major in liberal arts, im a business major",11,"so. right now i'm an accounting major, and i love accounting but it is difficult. with my degree, i would want to go to a small local firm and work there as an accountant, just filling out sheets and all that. i'm not interested in the big business scene as wall street and all that. i have to attend a lot of business events as being part of the business college, and i have to take other business classes that aren't accounting because of the business core. 

and when i'm in these classes, i feel horrific. i hate the business scene so much, it's just sharks taking advantage of other sharks and it's disgusting. i know, it's ironic, ""aren't u a business major?!"" yeah but i feel like accounting is different, because someone can be an accountant in a local firm and not have to constantly act like a shark.

anyway, that leads to my point of that i go to a liberal arts uni, and i had to take an art history class because of gen ed's. and i loved it so much. i wanted to declare it as a second major, but they don't offer it anymore, so i'm minoring in it. but right now, i was looking at the degreeworks for the history BA degree and some other liberal arts degree. and i love the courses so much. i would freaking love to go to college to study those courses. but i can't. because history/liberal arts majors have a difficult time getting jobs, let alone being paid well. and it sucks. it just sucks. i wish i could study whatever i wanted to. i'm very lucky that i recevied a lot of aid, so i'm basically going for free to my uni. so i could get a history BA and art history minor for free, without any debt. but then what afterwards? what would i do with my life after? sure, a teacher or historian, but teachers get paid low and historian is very hard to get. 

my boyfriend's mom majored in some linguistics in the best university in poland. and she's been working different jobs in america not related to her major at all, and getting paid decent money. i wish i could be like her, but it won't work in my favor. i hate capitalism. i hate that we cannot major in whatever we wish to.

401,Exam Note Mix-Up,30,"I'm a university employee taking a statistics course due to them having a program that reumburses us for up to four credits a semester.

I'm not good at Statistics, the reason I'm taking it is its the lowest grade I got as an undergrad and I'm trying to boost my GPA.

As a result, I take the course VERY seriously, especially since if i get a low grade I'm going to be out over a thousand dollars. I've gone out of my way to get 100% on every assignment so far, and I've done every extra credit opportunity. I want an A. But at the end of the day, Assignments are only worth 25% of my grade. Exams are 75%

In class, my professor announced that we were allowed two note sheets for the exam, and that we needed to be sure to bring a copy of Table A. Awesome.

I went to the exam with two note sheets, and a copy of Table A. My Table A was unfortunately printed out on two seperate single sided sheets of paper. I should have set it to print double sided but I forgot, and I didn't think it mattered.

It mattered.

I get to the exam and I'm told that I'm only allowed to have two sheets of paper. I wasn't allowed to bring any of my notes. My Table A counted as both sheets of paper since it printed single sided, even though the other side was blank. Why they didnt just provide us with a copy of table A and tell us we were allowed one note sheet? No idea.

Unfortunately, I looked online and sure enough it said only two sheets of paper. My fault. I should have double checked everything online too.

I emailed my professor about it and he said ""Sorry, the idea was you would print out Table A and use the extra space to write notes. Please be more careful next time.""

Ugh. This is crushing. I still think I did pretty well but I know I missed at least one problem due to not having all of the emperical rule percentages memorized. If I had been allowed at least one of my note sheets I don't think I would have missed any problems at all.

I hope I'm still able to get an A in the course but this is a rough start.

TL;DR I misunderstood the exam guidelines and wasn't allowed to bring any of my notes to the exam.",Sylph_Co
402,professors constantly bringing up their political views,0,"I'm an engineering major knocking out my history/government core classes this semester. these are pretty much the first liberal arts courses I've taken in college.

is it just normal and expected for professors to comment on their political views, and even test over them?

these courses have 800+ students each, standard intro core-required history and government.

in history it's fairly subdued, just mentions and calls out a single side every chance he gets. I don't really have an issue with calling out historically relevant comparisons, but he clearly targets only one party with these negative comparisons. For example, he brought up Trump's NATO remarks somewhat randomly during the discussion about naval blockades in WW1.

government it's fairly blatant. several exam questions discussed the current political landscape, and arguably don't even stick completely to the facts (example: there was a true/false question 'President Biden supports the bipartisan senate bill to lock down the border, while Republicans in the house have made no progress and threaten to block the bill at Trump's behest' -- which is at best misleading, the bill is hardly bipartisan with 1 R cosponsor and the house did make progress when they passed HR2 8 months ago.)

another T/F example that I feel is up to interpretation: 'president trump's tax cuts favored the upper class and businesses while president Bidens inflation reduction act was a landmark piece of legislation for the poorest Americans'

'the majority of coronavirus aid that sparked increasing inflation after the pandemic was disbursed under president trump' -- not only is this untrue, but the covid bills were close to unanimous so it's disingenuous at best to blame the president. 

questions are paraphrased but have the same substance as the actual exam.

that government class also runs a podcast that were required to listen to, and has a heavy slant. 

I'm not really on either side. I'm just pretty shocked to see what appears like blatant disregard for separating politics from the classroom.

I can understand the need to discuss politics in government, but imo there's a difference between discussing neutral facts (this happened, cause and effect, etc) and opinionated slant (this was bad or good)

i noticed that they don't talk to me very often, they're always hanging out together and no one says anything to me. i know they're close but it still lowkey feels pretty bad. they don't say bye when they're about to leave, when i walk in and they're home they don't acknowledge me, my roommate doesn't even say goodmorning. i have to be the one to even just say ""hi"" because i feel like if i don't, it'll be really awkward. they're always eating lunch and dinner together without me etc.

yesterday it was my roommate's birthday and they both invited their friends over and did a celebration in the living room and no one invited me and i literally stayed in the bedroom crying because I've never felt this forgotten before. my roommate walked in for a second to take something from the room, saw i was awake, and didn't say anything to me at all. i literally cried for at least an hour, not even exaggerating this.

i know they're closer and I'm not expecting them to include me all the time but not being spoken to at all is starting to feel really awful. me and my best friend never do this when there's someone with us. whenever i go to her apartment, i hangout with both her and her roommate. i feel like being close with someone doesn't mean you have to exclude the third.

408,IT Senior Project Based Rant; Why is my professor refusing to let us use the ONLY software weve been taught to use?,12,"I am so frustrated. He is new to the university this year, so maybe he isnt familiar with what we use and learn.

My entire 5 years ive been in college, we either used physical devices (pre covid, only one semester) or we used a singular software (packet tracer). Going into this class, we were given the freedom to use anything we wanted or buy our own physical machines or software. Our school pays for the license for the software we have learned to use, so I thought that would be fine.

Come to find out, that is not acceptable for him. He suggested GNS3 (free) but you have to buy the additional software (cisco IOS) to actually use the software. By my peers, I was recommended to buy a $150 license that included a few different download types. I waited until my project was approved (week 3, if it wasnt approved we auto failed the class/currently week 5) to buy the software. I then downloaded what I thought was right. Then i opened GNS3, and had 0 idea how to use it. I dont even know what to google.

I spent 2hrs with my teacher (who semi knew how to use it, but 1.5hrs was just a back and forth of clicking the same buttons over and over) to then find out I bought the wrong thing (possibly. Another student bought it and has no issues). 

Why cant we just use what we know? What it is going to hurt? Why cant there be any genuine lessons or classes that teach us how to use these preferred softwares? 

TLDR: bought $150 software that isnt right. Have to use another software with 0 instruction and very confusing.",Melody71400

413,I’m so torn about switching my STEM major. Advice?,7,"TL;DR: Struggling between keeping my childhood dream major or switching to my passion (in which I actually get good grades).

Hey guys.

I’ve been struggling with this notion for so long
now and I need advice.

My current projected major is Wildlife Sciences. I’ve wanted to work with animals for as long as I can remember. I’ve recently been looking at jobs in wildlife rehabilitation. I feel like it’ll be super rewarding work. And I know at the very least there will be job opportunities that pay at least enough to survive.

However, I hate my classes. I hate taking math and I hate taking lectured sciences. I barely understand what’s going on. I struggle to attend them because of this. Although I do love labs, I think they’re super fun.

On the other hand, I’ve been thinking about switching my major to something like Creative Writing or Journalism. While this has not always been my dream, it’s my passion. I love writing. I love reading. I want to publish. I want to edit works, I want to get feedback on my own. I’ve been writing on my own for years now.

And honestly? I love the classes. I’m succeeding in them, A’s in all. Not only do I find them easy, I’m super interested in them. I have all classes pertaining to this on Tues/Thurs and those are the days I look forward to by a longshot. But I am concerned about finding a good job in this field.

What can I do? What do I do? Do I abandon the field I’ve been into since childhood? Do I push through it? What If I regret not switching?

I’m so fucking frustrated right now. My STEM classes make me feel like a failure. I can barely get above a C in them. But everytime I get back a writing/reading response or quiz, all I hear is good things. Please tell me I’m not alone in this?",thegh0stcat
414,Posting here because I'm trying to cope with the absolute bullshit my college just pulled on me.,113,"So my next semester is coming up in just a couple weeks. I had already scheduled my classes for this term last year so I didn't think I had any reason to be concerned. One of my classes is the next level of Spanish that I need to graduate. 

So today I check my class schedule just to remind myself of who the professors were and what the room numbers are. Only to see that the Spanish class has vanished. Initially I took it to be a simple visual bug on the app so I wasn't too concerned. My college isn't the best with technology so things like this aren't completely out of the ordinary.

I check again a few hours later and it's still gone. So I log into my college's website and check on my registered classes. This is when I start to get really concerned because not only is it still not there but I can't even find it when I search for it. The class had simply vanished.

After about 30 minutes of panic researching I discover that that specific class was cancelled and replaced with other options for taking the class. And the college did this without notifying anyone! I know because I received no notifications regarding this and upon checking with a couple of my classmates none of them did either. Like myself they were just lucky that they checked in time or else they would've missed the deadline to register for one of the replacement classes.

I'm honestly so enraged by this. If I had just happened to be checking on my classes a few days later I would've missed the deadline to register for a replacement! And then I don't know what the hell I would've done because as I said I need this class to continue progressing!

And that's not it either. It gets worse! The original class I signed on for was just 1 1/2 hours for 2 days a week. The replacement is 3 hours for almost every day of the week. And apparently it seems that more material and tests/quizzes/exams are being squeezed in too. And they're giving us more work to do at home. I had planned for this to be a relatively chill semester but now it seems there's going to be at least a few sleepless nights in store for me which is JUST WONDERFUL THANKS!!

All that shit and as I said the college couldn't even be bothered to tell us! Do they not think that canceling a class is something that people who had registered might need to fucking know?!

Hello all. I just needed to vent and also ask for some opinions on how maybe yall would’ve handled this situation. I am a full time online college student. So since I never go in person, most issues are taken to email and explained thoroughly on what can be fixed on an assignment. Now I have NEVER in the 3 years I’ve been in college been told I plagiarized anything. Two weeks ago I see a zero got put in for assignment 7 in my Human Resources class. I immediately emailed my teacher and asked if I did something wrong. She told me to “check my plagiarism” I asked if she could specify what I plagiarized on her end, and she told me to find my plagiarism report in canvas. I ended up finding the report and I got flagged MULTIPLE times for WORDS. I wish I was kidding. I got flagged for using the word “modified”. Now like I said this was assignment 7 and I had done every single other assignment the exact same way I did this one. So I was obviously confused? I let it go and just tweaked a few things and resubmitted. Now last week was assignment 8-9. The grades got uploaded today. Assignment 8 got a 100. Assignment 9 once again flagged me for plagiarism. I pulled up the report for assignment 9 and it AGAIN flagged me for using WORDS. I got flagged in this one for using the sentence “The XYZ Theory” at this point I’m aggravated. I email her a pic and asked if I’m getting flagged incorrectly with the website she’s using, and if she could explain how to change this going forward so I don’t keep getting zeros. Mind you anything I quoted was referenced. I wasn’t getting flagged for that stuff. Her response? 

Hello (my name) 
I don’t like the fact that you’re aggravated and sending me pictures of your report. If it says you plagiarized then maybe try fixing that. You’re more than welcome to go to the tutoring center if this still isn’t making sense to you. 

YALLLL. I let her have it. I won’t lie. I told her as my teacher I should be able to ask her specific questions and how to move forward so this doesn’t keep happening. I said I CERTAINLY do not need a tutor and as I’ve explained to you in MULTIPLE emails, all of the assignments have been done the exact same way but it’s somehow has only flagged me on two of them? I figured I could ask my teacher but sure Mrs. I’ll figure it out myself. 

I won’t lie. I immediately regretted it as soon as I hit send🥴 she replied to me but I haven’t opened it yet. I honestly don’t wanna know. I know I pissed her off. I don’t know how to move forward from that, oops. I was just gonna redo the assignment and apologize for my tone in my last email as I was very flustered.

418,"College is kicking out upperclassmen from dorms, leaving them homeless.",713,"I just got an email this morning from the housing department saying they plan for several dorms to be freshmen only. 3, to be exact. 3 of our LARGEST dorms to be exact.

Apparently, it was an idea by our president for a ""Freshmen Village"" to increase retention. However, freshmen only make up like 25% of the population - if that! A lot of freshmen are dual credit students, they don't even come to campus much less live here. The dorms left over are being cut to half occupancy and are small. Combined, they fit about 1,500. There's currently 8,000 upperclassmen.

We do not live in a city. We live in a small mountain valley where the college campus takes up 1/3rd of the town. All the houses are owned by families in the town. There are no apartment buildings minus the dorms. The homeless shelter is full. The closest trailer park is 40 minutes out. Even then, the housing department just said ""oh well"" in the email. They told students to quickly do their returner applications because they anticipate not having enough rooms.

So. Where do we go? What do we do? Thousands of upperclassmen are now worrying about being homeless now. I'm in the same boat, but even moreso as not only do I rely on summer housing but break housing as well. As it stands, the disability and break housing building is at 1/2 occupancy as the other half of the building was bought out by a highschool program. They're buying out another couple of floors and a half. Not only are the implications of highschoolers and upperclass college students living together very weird, but it leaves less open for disabled and homeless students.

Im stressed out. I have nowhere to go. I have no family. Several of my friends are the same. Do we just pack everything in a bookbag and sleep outside? A bunch of homeless students are trying to organize a protest where we all sleep outside the admin building and the president's house.

We don't get many freshmen. I understand maybe ONE dorm, but our three LARGEST dorms?! It makes no sense! This is after he said he's working on getting rid of all non-stem departments and refusing to allow current seniors the ability to graduate with their degrees.

I can't go anywhere else, I can't afford a car and public transport is nonexistent here. I'm just stuck here.

TLDR: college is making the three largest dorms freshmen only, leaving 8,000 students to fight for 1,400 spots in a small valley town with no other options",angeyberry

The thing is, I want to work. I loved my internships, I genuinely enjoy the field I’m working towards. But college classes are absolutely draining my soul. I genuinely miss working, I even miss my minimum wage job. I learned so much more working in my field than learning about pointless subjects that don’t relate to my goals.

422,I tried to hurt myself last night due to my academic performance but I failed.,54,"
I am a junior Computer Science major at a small liberal arts college. After not performing as well as I’d liked last semester, I’ve told myself that this semester I will get myself on track: stay up to date with assignments, visit office hours, and study often.

I stuck with it at first, until I experienced one of the worst mental health crises of my life. I’d had a similar experience my freshman year of high school when I was just a wreck all the time and I was crying every day about my grades. But this time its worse. I have severe OCD and my perfectionism in making sure my homework is correct and won’t have points docked led me to fall behind heavily. I’d come to class and not be able to keep up with the lectures. That, and my OCD was steadily getting worse. I made the decision to start medication.

Unfortunately, this only worsened it. The side effects from the medication made me feel awful, and I wasn’t doing much else other than sleeping all day. It made me incredibly depressed. Because I was falling behind and not completing assignments, I got an academic alert for one class. I’m not sure if it’s a universal thing at colleges, but here it’s basically a notice to you and your advisor about the professor’s concerns about your class standing. I felt awful, and it quickly built up. I was having trouble focusing at work because I was so worried about my grade, My friends were constantly worried about how distraught I was becoming, and it all reached a breaking point. Last night, I tried to overdose on my medication by taking a bunch. 

It didn’t work, clearly, besides making me feel like absolute garbage and since my friends live on my floor they were aware of what happened and were now even more concerned about me. my best friend took my medication and hid it from me so now he has to give me my pills, and my other two friends want to speak to me later today. 

then, when i woke up from that awful experience, i saw i had received another academic alert for being behind in my class.

i feel like an absolute failure, and a disappointment to my friends, my professors, and to my advisor (who gets emails every time i get an academic alert). i just wish it didn’t seem like i wasn’t trying, because i am. i’m trying really hard but everything is too much apparently for me to handle and i don’t know why. i can’t just drop the classes because i’m so close to meeting my requirements but i feel so bad for my professors that i don’t know what to do. i know i should email them and explain but i’m scared it’ll sound like i’m making excuses.",lawfullytired

424,130 bucks just to submit paperwork.,30,"Ugh. I'm so angry.

I went to community college for 2 years and did very well. Honor's College, 3.8 GPA. Stupid me thought applying abroad was the golden goose, bit off more than I could chew without researching the culture.

Worst of it? The college I went to was unaccredited. So I essentially wasted my time. Got a job to support myself, tried to learn the language, everything, 2 years behind, fucked my GPA from a 3.8 to a 2.2 because I couldn't speak the language.

So I decide, ""Okay. New start. Let's go back home and get a proper degree, an accredited one this time."" Only to learn I have to submit the unaccredited Uni's paperwork. I feel that'll completely ruin my chances of getting in. Not only that, I have to have my transcript evaluated by some horribly expensive 3rd party??

So on top of that 80$ fee to apply to uni in the first place, I have to pay $130 ***just to get my transcript looked at*** when I don't even want to transfer any credits or reference it at all. If I could leave it off my application I'm confident I'd look better.

Fuck my life dude. This is what I get for trying something new. 

Fuck this university. The way it does examinations and evaluations is so counter-productive. You get an A just by sitting in class every day and shilling out shitloads of cash to live nearby. The whole thing is a scam degree that you can't even use. I dealt with straight-up racism most of my time here and for what? Just to run away back home with my tail between my legs and have to pay ***more*** money? God damn it.

TLDR: went abroad to an unaccredited uni because i didn't think, hated it, have to report it in the transcript and it's expensive to just report it.",YotsuyaaaaKaaaidan
425,Annoying dude in my math class,219,"I'm bad at math and i'm getting my associates for sociology so i'm currently taking math for liberal arts with tutoring. My teacher is great, though she does have a slight accent but i can understand most things she says and my classmates are pretty okay too except for this one guy. He constantly shouts the answer to a problem the teacher is doing before she's even done talking (rude imo, he could wait until she's done explaining) and says things like ""its obviously 25 pfft"" or makes snarky remarks saying that it's too easy. one time he even tried to challenge the teacher on how to prove something was right when she is literally our instructor like bro. we are literally taking possibly the easiest math class because most of us struggle with it, but even if he's just taking this class as an easy A for him or whatever he could just shut up and do the work and leave if it's that easy instead of being rude in general.

426,Why is college still pitched as a wonderful time when it seems like everyone's struggling?,189,"And yet at the same time, the struggle feels very isolating. Often it seems like people who post about struggling still seem very very normal on the outside, social, composed, etc. and you feel even worse because your struggles aren't as aesthetic

427,Writing Assignment for Non-Writing Class; Complete Time Sink,137,"Here’s the thing, I’m not even irritated at the assignment. All things considered, it’s not hard or even unexpected. It’s just fucking time consuming.

 I’m a super senior with 8 years of college under my belt. I have a 1.5 hour drive to and back from class every day, with the same commute to work. That’s 3 hours, every day, 7 days a week. My weekends and Tuesdays are work and then school. I have a full time class load as my financial aid doesn’t allow for part-time.

So when a professor, in a class of 6 students, decides on week 2 that he’ll add a research paper and full presentation to the work load of a hard, lecture-heavy, class. Yeah. I’m pissed. I already don’t have enough time to do anything other than what other people want me to do. I live my life in service, 24 hours a day, to professors, co-workers, project leads, etc. 

Your class doesn’t need an essay. It’s not even a hard essay, but it’s going to now eat away at the last bastion of self-care and time I have; which is precious little as it is. Looking at my schedule, I’m not even 100% sure that I have the time to actually do this essay.

428,The DRC Can't Help Enforce My Accommodations,14,"I get time and a half for all tests per my accommodations from the DRC, and in previous semesters this has gone perfectly fine. However, I'm in an online class where the professor has not responded to any emails pertaining to my accommodations a month into the semester. Our first exam is due this Friday, and he hasn't added the time, nor has he filled out the Alternative Testing Agreement that all my other profs have.

The Disability Resource Center (DRC) basically said they'll try to email him but if he doesn't respond there's nothing they can really do. His office hours don't happen until the day the test is due, and the DRC closes early that day, so even if he filled it out right then they wouldn't have time to process it. I'm at a loss for what to do. I've never had a prof be so uncommunicative, and this whole situation has made me feel so unwelcome as someone disabled in college. Those imposter syndrome thoughts creep up sometimes, and now they've increased tenfold. It's not like I've been asking for a luxury. I get the feeling he just doesn't want to have to manually change the times for each test of mine...

TL;DR: Prof won't respond to emails to give me my DRC accommodations of 1.5x on tests. First exam is this Friday!",Organic-Ad-2

I literally have 18 credits in biology that this school that I transferred to wouldn't accept. This professor's tests are insane. Open note, open book, open internet, because they case study format so you can't google the answers anyways. She's our genetics professor, I expect tests for genetics to be this difficult. For bio 100? what the fuck? They are obnoxiously hard. The way she words these questions makes my brain want to melt, it's like reading something written in another language. Like how do I go to her and say ""hey, I'd like to pass your class this time but coming from experience, your tests are obnoxiously hard for a 100 class."". and she's only been a professor for a year or two so it's not like her methods are tried and true and known to work.

Even though we weren’t in the same program, I used to see her from time to time, she was constantly stressed out and revising, just like all of us tbh, but I never imagined it would end like that.

I remember the last time I saw her, it was back in December, she didn’t seem well, she was super anxious about her exams but we still had a small conversation, they had another exam about two weeks ago in which she unfortunately didn’t get the minimum score to pass, and from what I’ve been told, it led her to take her own life, she passed out three days ago and unfortunately passed away this morning, and I have a hard time realising what happened.

432,I am currently in a group project where all my group members are useless. What should I do?,12,"Hi all. Another class, another group project going terribly wrong. This has been the story of my life since group projects started in secondary school/ middle school. But I think this might be one of my worse ones yet.

I am very smart and very obsessed with my grades. I thought other college students would also be like this, but nope.  1 person never responds or speaks anything. The 2 other people actually speak during weekly meetings, but do zero work outside of the meeting. 1 of these 2 idiots asked me to send the shared document when I already emailed it earlier. The 2nd idiot seriously asked me for help on their other prj like 10 minutes before part 1 was due. What the fuck?

I told these people I need help. I already did so much work. It is 100% my work so far and obviously way more than expected 25%. I told them what needs to be done, but they don't care. I am honestly on track to finish this entire project by myself.

What the fuck should I do? The chat shows they are reading my messages. I just want an A in the project and in the class.  Should I tell my group I will report them if they do not participate? Should I then contact my prof about this insanity? I have messages and other proof that show all my work and these idiots just leeching off me. ",Terrible_Exchange653

I attend class now and then to keep myself sane, but I don't go there to learn. Most of the time, less than half to the class is actually there.

I’ve found more resources for harder classes and have made lots of good friends. Eating healthier, gym going, all that stuff. But I make so many stupid mistakes on my work. One of my professors doesn’t upload grades since he doesn’t use technology. I bombed a couple homeworks but got a 90 on the first test but idk what my grade in the class is, he said he’d curve the homeworks as each of us screwed up a bit on one or another. The class is C-walled. I may just ask the professor tomorrow what my grade is as I need to take the next class in the series by next semester to graduate on time.

I'm in therapy and have been for the better part of a decade, but I have never completely lost motivation like this. 

Everything is just feels so pointless. I was supposed to start a position in my department upon graduating, but my boss has been hinting that I should look for other work, which is their way of saying the job offer is no longer on the table. The job was a great stepping stone for ultimately going to grad school in the near future, but I'm not sure if that's going to happen either. So now I am in the process of applying to jobs while working 30 hours a week, taking 18 credits, and fulfilling leadership duties.

436,The birth of online schooling,6,"Back in the day my college was very eager to try out online grading and testing so they hooked up a bunch of old desktop computers online and installed some new AI software for testing and quizzing students. The problem? A random glitch was causing the timer to accelerate to about 30 seconds for 1 out of 100 students despite complaints they kept on with the method stating that the students who failed obviously hadn't studied. 

The complaints kept coming in. Funny thing it was always random students. Even some of the highest scoring students were getting failed. The timer would give you 30 seconds... so with luck you could maybe get 1 page right. But the internet was slow enough that it took 10 to 15 seconds to load the next page. 

Finally we banded together and whenever one of us took a test we had others recording on their phones and managed to catch two instances of the glitch. 

Needless to say we gratefully went back to paper quizzes and tests which the professors were not happy with since they had to grade them 🙃 or hire on more graders. But the system worked lol and all of the students who claimed of the glitch got to re-take said quizzes lol so many rooms were filled with various students retaking quizzes which eventually lead to the option to retake failed paper quizzes but not tests.",AwakenTheNarrowRoad
437,My professor openly mocks and demeans the section I'm in and it's incredibly rude.,31,"I'm taking a Calculus for Non-Majors course, and from the very opening of  the first lecture, my professor didn't hide how much disdain he has for  our class and how ""slow"" we all are. He told us that he's only teaching  his course as a personal favor to the dean, and he greatly dislikes how dumbed down the course objectives are compared to the equivalent he teaches for Math/Engineering majors. Almost every class he has mentioned how much  further ahead the other class is, and how there's no reason why we should struggle on concepts that ""should be trivial to first-semester  freshman straight out of high school.""

It's  my last semester. I don't want to stir any shit that might get in the  way of me graduating (He's also a department chair and has tenure), so I'm just doing my best to ignore it. I still think it's incredibly hateful and shitty to say. There are many reasons why someone might not  want to or be equipped to take a higher level/more fast paced math course, and to ridicule people just trying to get through a core  requirement for most of the university is an awful thing to do.

438,This is the lowest point of my life,32,"I just wish I never had that surgery, that I just went ahead and kept my job instead, that I never talked to my parents about that blister, and that I never ever fucking went to college. Now I'm looking at the risk of getting kicked out, not getting my degree, and being jobless, and I'm already fucking pissed at everything. 

For further context, back in July, I started to have some pain in my body, and it gotten to the point where I told my mom that I had it (looking back now I regret ever telling her shit). She then took me to the doctor, who said that I have some form of a cyst, and that I need it removed as soon as possible. I refused, because I had a semester that I need to finish, as FAFSA and my financial department at my university is ruthless when it comes to medical excuses, and plus I already fucked up by wanting to graduate early, but since the industry I wanted to go into has imploded, I can't do anything. 

Of course this has caused a situation with my manager at my current part-time job, where I am struggling with the fact that they can't schedule me when I'm off surgery, plus the swing shift where I work is popular so now people are going to be grasping over my situation. So I decided like an idiot with my physician to have the surgery finished in December, and I should be recovered by March. 

Unfortunately, when I reached out, I talked to my manager who said he only has a night shift, and my parents are pretty much saying if you do that night shift, I am kicked out of the house. But at the same time they refuse to pay anything for college, so now I have to deal with debt when I graduate, or I have to quit college entirely, but it'd be a sucker since I have 6 classes left before I graduate with a shit ton of useless experience. At the same time, I also am struggling with the fact that if I lose this job, I lose my only source of income to pay for college, and rent, so now I'm going to be stuck with virtually nothing. 

I could look for other jobs, but they pay worse, so even if I save up, I won't have enough to pay everything for one semester, as I am barely getting by with this part-time job and rent on top of that. FAFSA doesn't help when you still have 10k to pay for the entire year, and that is what I am banking my savings on. 

I just don't know what the fuck to do. I wish I had still stayed with that part-time IT job, but they let me go. I wish I had stayed with that part-time restaurant job, but they don't have people. It comes down to this shitty pendantics with threatening family members, unburdening managers, and underlying college requirement on top of that. I wish I could take a gap year, I wish I could've saved the surgery til summer, I wish I had never told my parents. But all in all, nothing I can do is basically either let the job go, let the house/family go, or let college go, and I wish I had made better choices than that. Fuck my life. ",maullarais

I added all of us to a group chat and we planned to meet 30 minutes before lecture to discuss the outline that was due Sunday. This was on Wednesday. Unfortunately, my friend caught Covid and couldn't make it to school that day. I tried to reschedule, but the differences in schedules made it tough a first.

I then decided that we might have to do one on ones and then relay information, but when I tried to privately reach out to V on Friday, she never responded back to me. Saturday, my friend reached out to her in the group to discuss the project, she never responded.

No. She stays for a long time just mixing and stirring, I began to think it was odd she couldn’t wait the 5 minutes it takes to boil pasta before she starts cooking but oh well, I thought that was as far as she’d go.

Wrong again. She than puts an oiled up pan on the burner next to me and literally starts cooking right than and there. I was pissed at this point. Did no one teach you to wait your turn?? It’s not like we’re close eaither, we all hang out in our room and don’t talk to each other.

They started laying in hard on him, basically harassing him. They used me in the argument trying to say he was harassing me when he truthfully wasn’t. He threatened legal action and screen shotted the group chat.

Like we just straight up don't have common interests or personalities. I'm ok with being, like, school buddies! We can chat and study at the same table between classes but, and I know this sounds mean, I don't want to text every day or hang out on the weekends or like, go out for dinner and stuff. And I don't have time even if I wanted to. 

Additionally, this might be me being a little paranoid, but I feel like some of them patronize me. Like I must be stupid or something to be at a CC at my age. My work tells a different story, but whatever. Had a classmate-friend assume I didn't know where a certain state was AFTER saying I'd been there. I was so taken aback I don't think I said anything at all, which I'm sure also made me look stupid, but whatever. 

No grand conclusion to this post. Would love to hear thoughts and opinions from other non-trad or community college students but of course I'd like to hear anyone's input lol.",chumbawumba666

447,My Professor has cancer and I want to drop the class because of it,3519,"One of my professors has cancer, so she moved the class online and she now does zoom meetings from her hospital bed. I feel like a terrible person for saying this, but I did not sign up for an online class. I don't live on campus and I have a class in-person right before hand, and it's really difficult to find somewhere to do a zoom meeting because I can't get home in time. She also gave me zeroes for multiple assignments I completed and turned in, and when I emailed her about it she told me to come to her office hours when she's feeling well enough to host them in person again. Her class has no organization anymore and she sticks homework assignments in the most random places (never the same place) and they are impossible to find so I've already missed so many. 

I just cannot do this. I hate sitting on the hallway floor to do the stupid zoom meeting, and then getting no credit for work that I did. Or getting a canvas notification that an assignment was due two days ago and seeing it was uploaded today. She said she was unwell and got confused with the due dates but she won't fix them! I wish her health and healing, but it might do her good to take a break from teaching :(",NoWhereas4959

449,Issue with a shitty textbook website,9,"
I am taking an asynchronous class this semester and the professor is making us purchase one of his books off a sketchy website that just consists of other books just mashed together into one with the assignment prompts and info on them.  ""whatever i'll buy it"", i thought. 

But what I failed to realize is that the book only allows you to open the ""book"" 3 times for you to download it and then it doesnt allow you to come back and READ THE BOOK YOU PURCHASED. so after I purchased the book i opened it on my phone and when I attempted to open it on my laptop it didn't allow me with a prompt saying i used up all my downloads even though i hadn't. It had a count labled with ""3 downloads remaing"" when i clicked the download link on my laptop and it still wouldn't let me. I emailed the professor and no response, there also isnt a refund option on the shit site. 

So now im out of 80$ and missed out on an assignment thats worth 20% of my grade. I can't widthraw either due to taking 12 credits this semester and i'll lose full-time status. Im seriously debating contacting my bank, issuing a charge back and buying it again through another card so I can actually have a chance to download the shitty book again with hopefully no issues this time. Anyone done anything similar? Sorry for the rant my anxiety is through the roof.",DysfunctionalIdiot
450,Professor didn't tell us what book we needed and is now upset with the class,611,"One of my elective classes is an online class on Native American cultures in the US. The teacher never told the bookstore what book we needed. The first week he provided a list of links that went to various articles and videos we'll need this semester. 

Two weeks ago I noticed the our required reading was not in the links. I emailed the professor and he was certain that the link was indeed there. I searched our class page and could not find it. He also didn't name the actual book in the post, just the authors name and the chapter so I couldn't just look it up and find the book. 

Next week we're supposed to read another chapter in that book. A bunch of students have been commenting on the class discussion board that they have no idea what the book is or where to find it. 

He finally posted a link to the book. The book is $85. He's pissed off at us that we didn't inform him sooner. There are posts from 2 weeks ago, plus my email. It's not our responsibility to make sure the teacher tells us the book we'll need.

I (20M) started back at community college this semester after taking a break from my studies last semester. In my intro to business class, we had our first exam yesterday. Due to my accommodations, I took my exam in the testing center and while my test went well, I heard from my classmates who took the test in the class that cheating was rampant. I’m worried I may have to retake the test even though I studied for it and did not utilize any dishonest means. Please let me know what I should do, thank you.

It is fucking horrible, I cant rest AT ALL. The only day I can actually get sleep is Saturday and when I wake up at noon at Sunday - I have to do homework anyway. Who the fuck invented this??

And okay, I get it, maybe it is a lot of information etc but NO
We WASTE SO MUCH TIME

We have mandatory classes everyday 9-12 am and mandatory lectures 3 days a week 1-5 Pm. AND IT IS ALL USELESS. Everyone reads everything themselves anyway, you can't possibly study/understand lectures - they aren't designed that way!! The stupid fuck who are our lectures are reading text from slides which they copied form 20 y.o textbooks. And they don't cover all the material! They cover like 20%!! AND THERE AREN'T ANY RECORDINGS OR ANYTHING

Why would you test me every day at the begining of the class on the material that we suppose to discuss THE SAME DAY in class?? How is that fucking logical? And like if I did not understand everything that I've read the night before (and it is not hard to not understand - textbooks are not always good at explaining concepts or cover something that is nuanced) and fail the test - I have to find my OWN FUCKING ""FREE"" TIME AFTER SCHOOL to go and redo the test or retell the material to the professor IN PERSON. IT CANT BE DONE AUTOMATICALLY ONLINE?? REALLY?? And IT IS THE SAME IF I MISS THE LECTURE

When it was first 3 years and all disciplines were the foundation of medicine and not clinical I used to just donate blood and it would get me 2 days of free time WHICH I WOULD USE TO STUDY because you cant actually understand the material if you just read the recommended textbook and that's it. THERE IS NO GOOD TEXTBOOK IN MY COUNTRY ON PHYSIOLOGY, BIOLOGY, PATHOPHYSIOLOGY, PATHANATOMY - they are Fucking Trash and all are OLD AS FUCK

And you know how we discuss the topic in class?? The profs (well, they are doctors, just to clarify) ask us some specific 
CLINICAL questions and we suppose to answer it BY READING THE GODDAMNED TEXTBOOK OR LECTURE (THAT JUST RETELLS IT)!!

""Well how do you manage appendicitis?""
Ah?? How do i WHAT? It says HERE IN THE FUCKING TEXTBOOK  etiology pathogenesis diagnosis and treatment I DON'T KNOW HOW TO MANAGE IT. Yes ill tell you the cause and the signs and like the treatment but it doesn't really answer your question of ""how do we doctors do it in real life?"" because YOU KNOW WHAT? WE DON'T FUCKING WORK IN HOSPITAL. Yeah SUCK IT USA and your 4 year medical school and hundred years of residency we don't go to hospitals or help doctors or nurses in the semester . WE HAVE 2-4 WEEKS OF THAT IN THE SUMMER. AND IF WE'RE LUCKY IN CLASSES OUR PROF WILL SHOW US COUPLE OF PATIENTS. AND COUPLE ARE LIKE 1 OR 2 OR 4. THAT'S IT. WE STUDY 6 YEARS AND WE HAVE NO, ZERO, NADA OF CLINICAL EXPERIENCE. And our residency is 2 years for any specialty AND YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR IT. YOU WILL NOT BE EMPLOYED. My fucking roommate in dorm is 2nd year resident of neurosurgery and HE WORKS IN A GROCERY STORE. And oh my goooood he is dumb as fuck. He doesn't know basics, he DOESN'T REALLY KNOW HIS SPECIALTY . He operates and he cant answer simple questions about the disease he operates. It is like Atlanta show - it is SO SURREAL

GOD DAMN IT if I just studied  on my own for the whole semester or the whole 6 years and just went to the exams at the end of it - I WOULD GET BETTER GRADES. I WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE TIME TO STUDY, I WOULD ACTUALLY REMEMBER ANYTHING YOU STUPID FUCKS

455,Group projects have never achieved what teachers say they do...,37,"I hate group projects! I am, perhaps, a bit biased as a both an older student (getting my first degree in my 30s, not military) and as an overachiever. Back in high school I was always the student who carried a group. 

I even have a core memory where all the seniors had had to do a knock-off mock UN group project and I was paired with two other classmates who on the morning of the fair were not only late but texted that they hadn't finished their parts. One of the history teachers (who I had a previous year but not during this project) felt so bad for me he ended up crudely drawing a map of my country and helping me finish the essential parts of my group members' sections. He then warned me to not let myself get taken advantage of in group projects like this in college. 

But I didn't go straight to college out of high school. Instead I worked and took community college courses here and there until finally going back 3 years ago. Since returning to college (and especially since transferring to a university) it's been constant group projects! And I am constantly needing to assert myself against incompetent and outright rude classmates. I always have to talk my group members into doing the work they said they'd do when they said they'd do it, and I have to educate them on why wikipedia pages (and similar sites) are not reputable sources.

Every single time a teacher assigns a group project, they try to say it's to teach students what it's like working at a job. But I've worked in many types of jobs of varying industries (retail, food, hospitality, healthcare, social services, advocacy, and real estate).

While it may be true you will work with coworkers you don't always get along with or who have different methods, most of the issues you go through in college group projects do not represent working in groups for work. Needing to coordinate your responsibilities outside of work time rarely happens if ever, you'll be dealing with that while you're ""clocked in"" and apart from coworkers missing work this isn't really a problem. Your coworker doesn't do their work and you have to pick up the slack? No, you tell your boss if they don't figure it out first and that person (unless there's nepotism or something similar) gets repremended or loses their job. 

I could go on and on with examples. I know there's tropes, especially in comedy media, where one employee does work they don't get credit for and it goes to some jerk who didn't do anything, but I don't think that really happens that often without consequences. And even if it did, why on earth would teachers want to promote that kind of behavior?? The lesson in these classes then becomes not about whatever topic the group is covering but either you can take advantage of your peers or you deserve to get taken advantage of but your peers. Or a third lesson that if you are the one doing most of the work and you stand up to your peers, not letting them walk all over you, everyone will hate you and good luck making any friends!

So it stands to reason that despite teachers claiming group projects teach students how to work effectively with others for their future jobs, the actual purpose is to make grading easier for the teachers and TAs. That's it. They could just be honest about it though.


TLDR: teachers are lying about the purpose of group projects, they just want to make grading easier, not to actually provide useful skills to students. ",IGotThisFreeChurro

So I will start off my saying- all of my professors' first languages isnt English and the issue is only with one professor, and he is perfectly nice and a good professor. All my professors have accents right now, his is just very thick.   
BUT I cannot understand a single word he says in class, which means nothing gets processed in my head cause there is so much more to try to process- its a physiology of reproduction course so theres a lot of uncommon anatomy and hormone and whatnot terms. I follow along with the slides for the lecture during class because visually I can watch the lecture slides switch, but I dont know any of what he is saying. I dont feel comfortable really asking anyone (eg him, department head, etc) for help because its not something he can really help and that doesnt feel appropriate.  I also cannot join the class virtually- if I could I would turn on closed captions since the virtual program the school uses can do that- but he doesnt do virtual classes (even for sick students- only if its an official accommodation). Doesnt help that the class is 8:30am too. My classmates dont seem to be doing much better but seem to at least be able to catch a few words here and there....

On a normal assignment, if you get a question wrong, you lose the ability to gain the point. On Inquizitive, not only do you lose the ability to gain points from the question if you get it wrong, it actively takes away points from your bank. Get 1 part wrong on a 10 part question? Say goodbye to all of your points, even if you only got 1/10 wrong. Get a question right, +100 points. Get the next one wrong, -100 points. Why am I gambling points?! I should not lose the points I just got on answering a question correctly. And I have to get to 800 points to pass the assignment. Like genuinely fuck off. 





It gives you the ability to read the textbook and answer the questions at the same time, but most of the time the goddamn questions aren’t relevant to the passages of the textbook it gives you access to!! The questions are so fucking vague too and one qualifier that you happen to glance over (because most questions are not formatted like this) will just fuck you over.

They treat their assignments and deadlines as if the only subject we all were taking any given semester was the only one, instead of, y'know, four or five courses per semester.

Deadlines get moved up by a week just because it fancied one of the professors, never respecting the schedule we were given by that same professor at the beginning of the semester. It was the deadline for the final presentations of the seminars (which involve field outings and extensive writing).

Another professor cites us for corrections for, again, the seminars without regard for us having lab classes at that moment. And if we try to argue, it falls flat. What am I supposed to do? Skip the class? I ended up doing it at the cost of my grade in that other subject.

Oh, and then the advisor for yet another seminar simply doesn't do his job. His only revision for our final paper throughout the semester and about 15 sessions with him was simply to tell us to add the discussion and conclusion sections. But for the final presentation, he did love to nitpick everything wrong. Well, if someone took the time to revise our paper, it wouldn't turned out like that.

Ugh, sorry, I really needed to rant.

P.D.: BTW, I'm not from the US neither am looking for advice. Some classmates, even from previous years, report this kind of behavior every year or so. It never changes, I just have to resign myself.",Asterlix
478,College is the biggest money grab ever.,146,"I'm sure an overwhelming number of people have talked about this before on here, but I need to rant...

I just got accepted to a four year university as a transfer student. I was accepted two weeks ago and already feel like I'm being robbed. Every single form comes with a fee. $50 application fee, $100 to confirm admission, $150 housing application fee, $35 to purchase an ID. Wanna know the most absurd one of them all? $200 for the orientation!!! $200 just to be shown around campus? If that's not the most ridiculous thing you've ever heard of then I don't know what is. Also, my school's dorms are notorious for having roaches. Excuse me? So I'll be paying over 30k for a roach infested dorm? I can't even properly comprehend how that is fair. With all the money they receive, they should undoubtedly be able to afford an exterminator. Surprisingly enough, they give a 15% student discount at the bookstore. That isn't enough in my opinion. They need to make that discount higher. They already get enough money from us. I don't even go there yet and they've already received a fortune from me. I barely make above minimum wage and half my paychecks have gone to college related shit. Can't wait to see what my first semester bill will look like. I'm applying to as much scholarships as I can and I filled out the FAFSA. I will also most likely be taking out loans. One plus for me though is that I'm transferring from a community college and already have half of the credits I need at the university out of the way. Regardless, I'm always reminded of how big of a scam college seems to be and I hope I'm not making a big mistake. I know so many people whose student debt is higher than their annual income. Can't wait to earn a bachelor's degree that I'll probably make shit money with. Unfortunately, I'm not someone who was blessed with wealthy parents. Even if they were, they wouldn't help me at all. Thankfully I'm not starting until the fall semester so I'm working my ass off and saving every penny I earn.

TLDR: College is the biggest scam in life and will make you go broke as hell",ShoppingNo7822
479,The horrors of an all-section study group…,5,"Let me set the scene. I’m in my last semester of my junior year. I have 6 in person classes, I’m quite stressed already. I’m in a class about supply chain with a 70-80 year old professor. The entire course just got reworked a few weeks before due to the addition of a new book. He’s not as savvy with technology as he’d have you believe.

About 65 percent of my class uses a Mac despite the fact the college and syllabus for every class in the business sector says to use a Windows, or rent one from the library. We have our first excel assignment, most of the class has no clue how to use excel. I got the work done a few days before the due date to get his opinions on my work. I show him right before class. “Looks great, I’ll have you walk the class through this.” I’m excited and scared. I show everyone how to do it. I’m running up and down the stairs to different students helping them with their problems. Having them raise their hand if they need me. It’s a success, a lot of people do it right from the class. Those who don’t, email me. Professor sees how well it went. Asks me to run a study group for his online section. 

He asks it in a way that you really can’t say no, says it’ll help my grade (it didn’t). I feel bad for the online students and for him, so I say yes. I make a GroupMe, send him the link, he sends it to all his sections. About a day or two, we have 100+ people. Most of them message me instead of asking for help in the group, so I can answer the group as a whole. I get irritated and mention in passing in the group I’m about tired of the class for one week. That night he joins, and gets upset at my message.

He mentioned to me that he thought of replacing me due to my comment. In my head, I thought “good luck. I see how fucked these students are.” But I just apologized and he asked me to keep it more professional. I’m not a professor, teacher, or TA but okay. As more people join, it erupts into a hate fest. Everyone hates our professor. 

It bubbles over to supposedly someone joining under his name and pretending to be him. They type just like him with the same typos and all. The person is extremely disrespectful, sexist, etc. a bit typical for our professor. People mention sending the messages to the dean and getting him fired. He then says he’s not the real professor. This fake professor said he needed to have a “heart to heart” with me. Keep this in mind for later.

The final comes up, and when I finish he calls me up to his desk. He tells me, in a heart to heart fashion, that me telling the students to just go to his superior hurt his feelings. His exact words were “you telling everyone to go to Blank, really hurt me, so thank you.” Now, I was done with this man. After the fake professor in the GroupMe, he accused ME of pretending to be him. Why? I don’t know. I was extremely irritated at this because I was the one that told him what was going on and that people were trying to get him fired. When he dropped this emo middle school “so thank you” on me, I just left. 

If your professor ever asks you to run a study group, just stay the fuck away. Even if it boosts your ego, you think you’ll get a letter of recommendation, just no. It’s not worth it.",BabySchizo
480,Back to School,5," Just wanted to vent for a bit.

I'm back in school after dropping out for a second (third?) time when COVID hit. I'm 27, and I haven't even finished my A.A. yet. I signed up for 3 classes for this spring term so get into the feel of things, and we're barely a month in with me already being panicky and avoidant of the work until I force myself to sit down. I'm taking English 2, Stats, and Speech. These are supposed to be easy classes and yet, it's still a battle to do the simplest of assignments. I was diagnosed with ADHD since last being in school, so I'm trying to be patient and not too hard with/on myself. I'm afraid to fail/drop out again, especially since this time my work is paying for it. I'm also getting married this year, and I feel I may have overestimated myself a bit. My fiancé offered to help me out, but between her work, schooling, and the wedding planning, it doesn't feel right to make her stop what she's doing in order to help me.

I just don’t want to continue feeling so miserable all the time.,Freshflowersandhoney
482,I have 5 weeks left in the last quarter of my computer engineering degree. I have hated every moment of college and feel that it was fundamentally a waste of time.,28," 

There has been a lot of talk in recent years about the value of a college degree in a time where the cost has ballooned exponentially and the education you receive is increasingly disconnected from the reality of the working world. My personal experience is that a college education is in itself essentially worthless today, and furthermore it is a miserable, awful experience for people who are not fully supported by their parents and/ or willing to take on massive amounts of debt.

First, I’d like to complain about the lectures. Most lecturers, in my opinion, are not fit to be lecturers. There is far too much monotone droning about math equations that simply have to be memorized to pass engineering courses. Also, at risk of sounding like an insensitive rightoid, the thick accents of many lecturers makes their lectures completely unintelligible. It is also an open secret that they also are very unlikely to give a shit whatsoever about undergraduate students and are far more invested in their research, or maybe grad students.

It should also be noted that the lecture material very rarely prepares you in any meaningful way to tackle the homework. I would estimate that maybe half of classes require material outside of the lecture and lecture slides in order to complete the problems assigned. That material often involves YouTube or other less savory sites like Chegg. What’s worse is that the homework, which the lecture material does not prepare you for, in turn does not prepare you for exams. The most successful students I met all sought out supplementary problems and material outside of what is provided by the course. Despite being so completely unhelpful in preparing you for exams, many assignments (especially the ZERO unit  lab assignments) take 8 or more hours to complete, and are extremely stressful and draining, poorly worded, and poorly organized.

What makes it worse is that I barely remember anything from a course after I have completed it. You are usually so busy that the only thing you CAN do is cram for exams, and once the knowledge is no longer needed, it leaves you. That isn’t intentional, it’s a consequence of being bombarded with so much information so quickly that you cannot physically retain it all.

What makes it worse for me personally is that the material doesn’t seem connected in any meaningful way to what is required by the software industry for getting or succeeding in a job. I have seen countless discussions, videos, articles, etc. about how college is poorly equipped to produce hire-able software engineers, and that has matched exactly with my own experience in applying to jobs and internships. Generally speaking, you are expected to know how to solve technical interview problems (algorithmic brain teasers that serve as a stand-in for IQ tests), and to know a laundry list of programming languages, frameworks, and tools, none of which will be so much as mentioned during your degree. I feel like college has more or less been an unfortunate distraction from learning the things I actually need to get a job.

Now, I understand that many people will see this complaint and say something along the lines of “College is about making you a well-rounded human being, it isn’t a job training center/ bootcamp,“ and I would agree with that. The problem with that line of thinking is that college does a very poor job of fulfilling that goal as well. If you really wanted to become a well-rounded human being with fully developed critical thinking skills, it would be wise to simply read the Harvard Classics series. Many other collections of classic literature and philosophical works would be a suitable stand in. A college education is not required to be a well-read, intelligent, educated human being, and I feel that the obsession with the legitimacy conferred by institutions that are largely concerned with the extraction of your wealth is in itself a sign that those same institutions have largely failed in their mission.

I also would say that I don’t really mesh well with college culture. I just do not like most college students. I am an older student, graduating at 28, and I don’t really care for youth culture or slang. That being said, when I was in high school I didn’t really care for the way many of my peers behaved or spoke. I never liked youth culture, even when I was young myself. The way people spoke, the music they listened to, the way they dressed, etc. were all things I found off-putting from a very young age. It hasn’t really changed much as I’ve gotten older, if anything it’s gotten worse.

All in all, I’m pretty damn bitter about my experience in college. It took me a long time to complete the degree for a lot of reasons. I barely graduated high school with the minimum requirements, so there was a lot of catching up to do on coursework that other college-bound students would have completed already. I also was only able to go part time for a long time because I was working to support myself full-time. I took a year off at one point because I was working something like 60-70 hour weeks trying to make ends meet. I dropped probably a year's worth of classes because I knew I wouldn’t pass them. I couldn’t get the courses I needed when I needed them, etc. During my upper division courses, I probably invested north of 60 hours a week to college every week. It feels like college is just trying to condition you to put up with taking work home with you and spending more than 40 hours a week at a white collar job, to put up with bullshit requirements and jump through hoops unquestioningly.

The material and requirements were just absolutely brutal. I was poor, I had absolutely no free time, couldn’t exercise as often as I wanted and either couldn’t or didn’t really want to socialize with my “peers,” was chronically sleep-deprived and over-stressed, and more.   


I hated it and I can’t even be happy or relieved that it’s almost over, I just feel bitter and sad.",TheDiscoJew
483,I’m not sure if I wanna do this anymore,26,"I’m a STEM major in my second year at a community college and about to transfer to a university after this semester but I’m already rethinking everything. I’m a bio major and want to enter the medical field but I’m not sure about it anymore. Currently I’m in a gen chem 2 class and I hate it. Maybe I would want to keep pursuing my dream of being in the medical field if I didn’t have to take chemistry, or not who knows.

If being in the medical field is going to be like this, the constant stress of not understanding of what’s going on and being scared of reaching out for help, then I don’t think I want to do this anymore? I know I should be asking for help since I’m struggling a lot but I feel intimidated and scared. I have been avoiding the homework since I have no idea how to do it and it seems like every other person except me knows how to do it. It’s so overwhelming and none of the things we are learning in our lectures are connected to the homework, just long reading.

I find more want and passion in art but I can’t get myself to do that because it won’t get me money to support my family in the future unless I’m wildly successful. I’m thinking of trying other things like switching majors to architecture because it’s interesting. Or maybe trying trade school even though I don’t know how it works but I know it would guarantee a stable future.

I don’t know anymore. I’m really scared honestly. I don’t want to pursue a future that I’m not sure I’m even passionate about but how would my family feel if I suddenly changed everything?

484,You don't want me to list things? Ok.,3,"I go to college online, and my anatomy professor isn't that terrible, but after submitting my first couple assignments he left me some feedback. 

Don't list things and use complete sentences. Well the complete sentences part it my bad, but he clearly says in the assignment to list, and describe the function of these cells/muscles, and where they can be found. So the only time I don't use complete sentences is when I list the answers. (Ex. Osteoblasts: Bone cell that is responsible for forming new bone, synthesizes and secretes collagen matrix and calcium salts - found in growing portions of bone including periosteum and endosteum)

So I followed directions to a T, all complete sentences, and no lists even when the question advised us to list the answers.

My last two assignments were over 1,300 words for a 10 question assignment, and 1,500 words for a 13 question assignment respectively including citations. All in paragraph form. I submitted them last week and they still haven't been graded yet.

It's more work for me mentally, since I can type 55wpm, but it's worth it cuz I still spend roughly the same amount of time for each of those assignments, but the Prof is gonna spend a lot more time grading it than I spent working on it.

His profile pic is a John Deere tractor too, when all my other Professors have professional looking headshots. Which is just weird to me.",clygreen
485,What Is It With Such Long PowerPoints In College?,12,"This may be just me but it's kind of being annoying me since I have started this year.  

I am in my second year of college and I study History, English, Psychology and Philosophy.  I love these subjects so much but I feel very overwhelmed by long PowerPoints, especially for English and History.  Last week in my English Lit lecture, the lecturer put up a PowerPoint sixty-four slides long, one one section of the novel we are studying.  And in my History lecture this morning, there were eighty slides on Napoleon alone.  How am I supposed to be able to write notes and study for exams with that much content to remember?  It's just too much to cover through a two hour lecture on it's own. let alone study it altogether for assignments.  

My lecturers also spend a lot of time focusing on the first ten slides then rush through the last of them towards the end because they want to cover everything in the lecture that day so they can move on to the next topic for the next lecture.  It's so much work to try get though, especially to try do work and activities outside of college.  Is this an issue for everyone or am I being dramatic? 

TL;DR: lecturers make PowerPoints really long and it is an overwhelming amount of content to get through",jenniescappucino

The metal string is so loud and my roommate thinks it’s a good idea to pull on them as hard as she can in the morning even though there’s already light shining through our room… like it’s so loud that you can hear other rooms opening/closing their shades. 

Also making a silhouette shower?? Like I already lack privacy in the room why would I want my roommate to see my every move in the shower. And not to mention the gross smell from the shower that seeps into the room since there isn’t even a real wall in between the shower and dorm.

487,First year professor she’s a disaster so far…,1115,"UPDATE- 2/12… class was in person yesterday, and as the majority of the class didn’t attend the Teams meeting where she lost her shit (only 8 out of 25 were there) because no one knew it was happening… so a few voiced similar concerns and she lost her shit again. Yelling over people, not letting anyone talk, at one point cut someone off yelling, then screamed “YOU DONT SPEAK WHEN I SPEAK!” after interrupting HIM. I (and about a dozen or more other students) spoke with the chair who pulled the Dean in, so we’ll see if they do anything. It isn’t getting better so we keep reporting it, there’s nothing else we can do. I’m considering dropping the class tho I don’t know how a W would look, I really want to avoid it if I can. 

Oh! She also talked CRAZY shit about our class to the next class, saying she couldn’t stand us… and decided, even though it’s the same class with the same assignments and expectations, to meet with them twice a week but will only meet with us once. We are losing an hour of class lecture because she doesn’t want to deal with us. 

UPDATE- I wrote a complaint today and submitted it to the chair, on behalf of myself and 7 other students. I’m sure there’s more, but those were the only ones who were in the room, and only ones who know we have class tomorrow!  I’ll keep you guys posted!

Our professor for our capstone is brand new and it’s a disaster. First day she tells us that she doesn’t like the 9:10a start time, and asked us that we all come in at 9a instead. It’s 10 minutes so it’s not too bad, but I’m 45m away and have to get kids on the bus so it’s tough. It’s not great, but I can (almost) manage. Then she tells us the class is hybrid and instead of meeting 2x a week we will only meet once. Great! Everyone informed their jobs. So the next Monday rolls around, I have to wait outside with my kid and take off like a bat out of hell after the bus. I get there at 9:02, the earliest I possibly could. 9:15 she finally walks in. Says that she got a few emails stating that some people couldn’t make it early so she “JUST DIDNT BOTHER COMING”. 

Oh, and she decided (in her mind) that we do have to meet 2x a week after all but didn’t tell anyone, and anyone who didn’t show last week counts as a missed class. No communication, no nothing. Now, people tell her they’ve already arranged their work schedules and can’t do it as she said class wasn’t meeting, and her response was “not my problem, you need to be in class”. 

Someone totaled their car on the way to school. He sent accident report, photos of the accident while he waited for PD, etc. NOT excused. She told him that she may have seen his emails but “she gets so many emails she doesn’t have time to read or respond to them all”. 

I personally have sent her 4 emails in the last 2 weeks asking for clarification on class times, assignment questions, etc. and haven’t gotten a single response. From what it sounds like from her other two classes, she doesn’t EVER respond or even bother reading her emails. 

Before leaving she said that she is going to post 3 questions on blackboard due tomorrow by 11:59pm. I check blackboard, she posted the 3 questions, along with a group project that she just never mentioned ALSO due tomorrow, and we will be presenting Wednesday morning. What?! She posted a breakdown of groups, I have no idea who any of these people are except for one. Oh, and the source we are supposed to use is a published research study and when you click the link she provides you have to pay $999 to download the PDF. I work 50 hours a week on top of going to school Ft and have kids at home. I don’t have any time to meet with a group at all, especially with no notice. 

This is going to be such an awful semester. I’ve only been to 3 classes and already considering escalating to the chair. I know 3 students from class left her class this morning and went to go speak to him.

493,8am classes are the bane of my existence,418,"I should start this post off by explicitly saying that I’m just here to vent/rant. Too many times it seems like people on this sub are mad at people for venting/ranting which is ludicrous. THAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS SUBREDDIT. Don’t like it? Leave. I’m entitled to rant/vent without people nitpicking me or complaining that I’m ranting/venting in a subreddit made exclusively for ranting/venting.

This semester I’m taking my first 8am class. It’s a studio art class that goes from 8-10am on Mondays and Wednesdays. So far I’ve missed two entire classes already and I have been late to at least two or three of them. I’m epileptic and have sleep issues. If I don’t sleep 8 hours I feel terrible all day and am at higher risk for a seizure even while on my anti seizure medication. I always struggle falling asleep nights before I have to get up early, and it’s proving difficult and unhealthy for me regarding this class. 

I didn’t drop this class because it was the only option of the few offered that worked with my other classes and I figured I could do it. Clearly I’m struggling and something needs to change. This class is required. If I drop this class now I’ll have to pay at least $100 for late drop. I’ll also only be enrolled in 6 credits this semester which isn’t acceptable for my government job, because it requires enrollment in 9 credits per semester. My job has a flexible schedule and I can start/stop working when I please, so I can sleep in for that. It’s too late to join any other course because it’s week 4. I already dropped my fourth asynchronous 3 credit course because I found out my 3 in person 3 credit hour studio courses will be a lot more work than I thought they would be. 

I’m really frustrated. I hate missing class/being late. I also hate having to explain my lateness and make “excuses” for my absences. This professor doesn’t seem to like excuses and has already wrongly marked me off points for my two absences despite his syllabus saying we have two penalty free unexcused absences. I doubt the disability center will help me even if I ask for grace periods or delayed start because they’ll probably say something like “epilepsy isn’t a visible condition” or “just wake up on time”. This really sucks. It is my own fault, and I admit that, but it’s something hard to control and not necessarily easy to do when I really need good sleep for my own health. It’s either not getting enough sleep each night before classes or I’m late to/miss classes in order to get good sleep.

TL;DR: I’m taking my first 8am course and it has been a nightmare. I’ve already missed 2 classes and been late to others. I have epilepsy so getting good sleep is necessary, but I’m struggling sleeping. It’s effecting my classes and is becoming an extremely irritating problem.",Retrocade86

495,Paywalled the Assignments,0,"So I presume we all know the pain that comes when you need to find a book for a specific class and end up handing amywhere from 50 to sometimes even hundreds of dollars only to end up NEVER using it because the way the professor wants you to do things isnt the same as how the book tells you. After experiencing such a thing, personally I decided to never buy another college book ever again, so I proceeded to pass all my classes with the wonderful power of google and online pdf versions of the books college wanted me to buy... but now my college gone too far. I received an email from my professor saying that I had missed the first assignment and he recommends this be the first and last assignment I missed if I planned to pass. I responded asking where this assignment was, due to the fact that the regular college portal, the thing EVERY class uses to give homework, grades and studying material, with the occasional google classroom, was completely empty, he hadnt even sent the slides we were discussing in class yet. He then proceeds to basically scold me because I wasnt paying attention the one day I missed class because one of my grandfathers died, which he already knew as I had emailed him previously. After the lengthy paragraph, he proceeded to send instructions on how to enter and buy temporary acess to both the online book AND the portal where all the assignments are located...

You read that right, in order to even SEE the assignments I needed to cough up $75 or else I cant acess the portal, because to acess the portal I have to have acess to the virtual book thats associated with the portal... WTF???? And worst part is, I wouldnt even have acess to the full book, just sections that he unlocks while we go in the semester, and this acess is only valid for 1 SEMESTER!!!!

As a broke college student, who has virtually no family support, and whose working at the college hes studying in order to make a little over $800 a month (under the poverly line for where im at mind you) just to survive until I finish college, HOW am I expected to pay to SEE my homework???? You can always get past needing to buy the books, but your telling me my grade will SUFFER cause atm I cant cough up those $75 bucks????

As always, I try to find a way to wiggle my way past these wallet gouging tactics with the most minimal ammount of loses, and turns out they have a 2 week long free access... but guess what... the free access takes effect at the begining of semester, BUT in order to apply for the free access, you needed to do so BEFORE the semester started... you know that time, its when your finishing up picking and moving classes around to fit your schedule, that time when your future professors are SUPPOSED to email you about the upcoming classes but NEVER do... thats when I had to apply for the free access to a portal I didnt even know existed, for a book I dint even know id need...

Lifes idiotic sometimes, but shit like this really reminds you how shitty everythibg can be...

TLDR: Never before used portal requires paid access in order to do and see ASSIGNMENTS because portal access is tied to temporary virtual book ownership... free access exists, only if you applied before the semester started, before the professor said anything about it...",Icarus912

498,I Wanna Change My Major,12,"I’m a junior in college right now, next semester will be the start of my senior year. I’ve been at this school for 2 years (I am a community college transfer) and have stuck with an adolescent education major this entire time but starting last semester, I grew wildly unhappy with it. I think my anxiety had gotten worse for outside reasons and just has been amplifying my doubts over whether or not this was the right way to go. As I continue with my fieldwork and being in a classroom, it’s stressed me out even more realizing what my life would be like and I just don’t think I can take it anymore. Right now my minor is history but I’m thinking of switching that to be my major and wipe education out entirely. I just can’t do it anymore but I worry that it’s too late in the game to make that switch, but I really don’t think I can stick it out another year. I’ve made an appointment for Monday with my advisor so I hope she will agree with me and help me switch, so this is mostly a shout into the void because it’s been making me so anxious for so long now.

Edit: spelling errors

Edit 2: Just filed the forms to change my major to history and my minor to education! No more fieldwork for me! I feel great but I also somehow feel guilty for making the switch and am already wondering if I made a mistake even though I was quite miserable in an education major.",Ellie_Bulkeley

How do you guys find what you want in life or what you wanna do for the rest of your life. Keep hearing to for something you're interested in or whatever you're good at. Some people say just go for a career that is finically rewarding. Some say use college as a stepping stone for creating a business in the future. Idk I'm just stuck and don't know what to do. I taken few online career quizzes but don't like it. Didn't find it helpful. The problem is I'm not even sure what I'm good at or what my strengths are this makes it more difficult.

501,Anyone else have a prof that doesnt teach? Why is this allowed?,71,"So im in community college striving for a AAS in Paralegal Studies. My law 101 (online class) professor simply doesnt teach - at ALL. All I do is read a chapter from a text book, and take a 5 question quiz that is timed for 5 minutes. Theres no videos, no communication, nothing. In all honesty i feel like this professor just exists as a facilitator for textbooks. Its ridiculous. Sure its kinda nice just to read the textbook and not worry about watching videos, but when the quizzes constitute 30% of your grade and have little room for error - its stressful as hell. We do quizzes through lockdown browser and aren't allowed to view notes or anything. And this is the only professor that teaches Law 101 at my college. theres no escape. I have more interaction from my anthropology professor than i do with this one.

I just failed my quiz even though i took thorough notes and reviewed the chapter before taking it. I understand the chapter 100%, but with little or no room for error in quizzes, its like wtf is the point? I feel like im not getting honestly evaluated on what i learned since theres only 5 questions. I feel like im getting robbed of a quality and fair education.

Anyone else deal with this bs? cause i feel like im losing my mind here. /rant

edit: im not so much upset with the quizzes being the way they are. but the lack of teaching from a college professor. i guess they were right when they said college is the worlds most expensive video streaming service. its eroding into a pdf facilitator too. i want a QUALITY education. yall can downvote all u want but that isnt gonna change how i feel (or how her previous students felt) about the bare minimum that professors should be giving to their students.",JFK360noscope
502,Sadness looking back...,5,"I feel so much meloncholy looking back at the past few years of college. I had a HS friend as a roommate freshman year and it was great but he dropped out. He was about the only person i talked to irl. Sophmore year my parents split up and i got a random roommate i never talked to. We were both too shy and said less than 20ish words to one another both semester. This year i have a room all to myself since my next roommate never showed up. It is nice but it has reminded me how alone i am here.

Besides socially failing myself so far my academics dont give me satiafaction either looking back. Classes, and mainly writing papers, have been hell on me mentally. I had confidence that first semester but looking back nearly every one since then has made me feel like a fruad somehow. I dont feel smart enough for the grades have and i feel like i dont remember anything. I dread the day i need to remember something from my classes in the future and with shame I have to say i dont know. Future doctors dont think like this.

Needing to look up academic sources for papers has also been a huge stressor for me. I feel like i dont understand a majority of what i read and i stay up late some nights wondering if i just made shit up as i went since i didnt fully grasp what i read sometimes. Accidental plagerism is also terrifying to me, it is such a big deal. If i did make stuff up here and there due to not fully grasping my sources doesnt that make me a plageriser? Saying a source said something that it didnt feels really shady to me. Deep down i hear myself saying the only reason i passed the classes was cause the professors didnt actually check my sources.

Idk how to put this to words but im honestly sad that ill look back on college as a time in my life that was very scary and stressful rather than fulfilling. A time i stagnated in my growth and slacked off and only got by on luck.",321ECRAB123
503,Core class in my PhD program may kill my chances of completing my degree,2,"I am currently in a PhD program for physics but all of my research will be in astrophysics so some of the core classes will not help me in anyway. The majority of the people in the department are nuclear physicists so Electromagnetism 1 and 2 are important to almost everyone, except those of us in astrophysics. The class is helping me in no way at all and is just going to kill my GPA. Luckily I came in with a Masters so I got E&M1 waived but have to take E&M2 since it was only 1 semester at my Masters program. I sat in on E&M1 but not for a grade, just wanted to see how the pace was with the professor and everything. In E&M1 he did 1 test and 1 final which seems a bit scary but I was prepared for that coming into this semester. However, he decided to completely change it to a midterm, final, AND TWO ORAL TESTS. None of us have ever had oral tests before and this is the first semester he's ever done this according to people that already took the class. He said at the beginning of the semester ""I'll give you guys a list of what could be on the oral test."" Come time to let us know and he says ""It'll be over anything we've talked about up to now plus the homework."" That's not a list. That's saying it's over EVERYTHING. I hate this professor, this class, and I am worried my GPA is about to drop below a 3.0 which will cause me to lose my scholarship of $30k. Also if I can get through this semester I'll be done with classes entirely. If not, I have to wait another year for E&M2 meaning I'll be here even longer. I'm already going to be here until I'm over 30 years old and I want to get out with this degree so I can actually make money and not live off of the pennies I currently get.

504,Getting sick in college is sm worse than in HS.,702,"Last semester I was sick a few times and it really made an effect on my grade in some classes.

I’m trying hard to not miss any days this semester. It’s only 3 weeks into spring semester and I woke up on Thursday with the worst chest pain ever, and short of breath and I still went to class. On my way to my next class I almost passed out a few times and about 5 minutes into the class I got up and left, but not before my professor yelled at me for doing so. I get back to my dorm, lay down for a little while and my chest still hurts and my heart rate is at 112 resting and my hands are turning blue. I take my temperature and I have a fever, so I couldn’t go to my third class. (Also I’d like to add that I’m feeling better now and I have some heart issues so stuff like this happens sometimes.)

505,Bitter about Options,3,"Long winded rant ahead, just something I need to get off my chest:

Some context- I go to a fairly big school, not the biggest, but still a large student body. Because of this and the fact that the program for my major is small, there aren't a lot of feasible opportunities for me to get internships or work experience. So, I got a job at a lab in another department. It's not the best, but its lab experience. Great, cool!

It gets to be a problem, though, at least to me, when people start associating me with the job-field rather than the major-field? Not just on principle (I dunno why, but this really bothers me) (ex. I'm not the 'tree guy' I'm the 'fossil guy.' I feel like this is bad for getting recognition/networking) also because I'm worried I'm leaning too far one way when I really want to be getting experience in the other.

I dunno if that actually makes any sense, but it's starting to get to me. I don't want to make it obvious, but I feel like even with that I come across as a little bitter. Maybe not at work, but in the job associated extra curricular I was roped into helping with by some coworkers.

TLDR; Don't get lab jobs in other fields unless you want it to start taking over your academic image(?)",byeseacat

508,I hate online timed assignments,11,"Ok not all online timed assignments. Minor quizzes that are only a small portion of a total grade don’t bother me that much. My issue with online assignments that count for a larger portion of the grade being on short timers is so much can go wrong for students and failing an assignment due to an internet outage or some other technical issue really sucks.

 Im in a class that has short timed quizzes (that are a pretty major chunk of the grade) that we’re required to write in LaTeX and submit via pdf and I might fail the assignment because Overleaf had a last minute freak out and I wasn’t able to download the correct PDF version and turn it in. Something like that should really just be open for a day rather than on a timer so if students encounter technical difficulties, they can correct.  

If the general wisdom among profs is “don’t wait until 11pm to submit something due at midnight in case you have technical difficulties,” why is it appropriate to assign something that is timed to less than an hour where a student could encounter the same technical difficulties?

I understand the need for timed assignments but just have them done in class so issues can be resolved should they arise. 

Tl;dr: failing online assignments on short timers because of technical problems outside your control sucks",

I wanted to take it at a community college and even signed up for that but then my 4 year college took away my funding because I wasn’t taking enough credits at their school. I’m so miserable and I’m so tired of struggling all the time.

I like the subjects of my classes MORE now so it's not the material. I feel so fatigued and lethargic. I had 0 absences and turned everything in on time WHILE working part time and this semester I can barely get out of bed. I've been calling out of work to do assignments that then don't get done because I'm too exhausted. I don't even want to talk to anyone. Hell, I don't even want to play video games or fuck around on my phone I JUST want to lay in bed. 

I almost want to talk to one of my profs or my advisor (who is also one of my profs lol) just to let them know something is going on with me, but since I don't actually know what's wrong, I feel like it's not worth it. I just don't want them to think I'm a slacker or stupid or whatever even though it's getting harder to convince myself I'm not those things.

I will say I can't stand the way my bio professor does assignments, which is contributing to my issues. Weekly 30 page ""click and learn""/video follow-along worksheets that I then have to write lab reports about? On top of actual wet labs and reports for those? It feels like busy work. I really like biology/ecology/etc and might want to pursue it for a career so it's making me sad that I'm having such a hard time with this class. 

I have tried to talk to classmates about this but it seems like a lot of them are only taking two or three classes. Which is cool and probably a lot more manageable, but I won't qualify for financial aid if I do that. I could, at most, drop ONE class, but then I probably won't be able to graduate on time.

Sorry for the long post. Hope everyone is having an ok time or at least coping well. I already know that's not true but I can dream. We will get through this hopefully lol",chumbawumba666
513,Receiving support from faculty/people in your field of study compared to blind support from family,3,"***This is a rant/ emotional purge.***

 I'm a first gen college student (out of my parent's kids) and who didn't grow up with too many in-person, tangible role models. Mostly inspired by folks on TV and such. As I started my journey back to school, I got lots of support from my family, but I soon realized they had no idea what I was actually doing or pursuing (environmental engineering). My mom for example loves to actively talk bad about math (which I ironically despise) and says things like ""who even needs to know that stuff in the real world?"" 

I realize now that I've always been the ""responsible"" or ""dependable"" child/sibling that other family members could call on to help them fix their problems (usually small things, but still time consuming). Now that I'm in the depths of school (junior) I'm almost always replying with ""sorry, I'm doing homework right now"" and I feel like a jerk.

 They still support and believe in me, but the fact that they still call on me for such small things like ""can I get a ride? Can you help me fill out this paperwork? Can you move/install this?"" I'm starting to get pissed off- but I don't want to take it out on them because that's how it's always been for us. We call on each other for help. 

But they can't help me with my algebra homework- they can't drive me the 2 hour round trip to school- or help me build a resume. And there is no effort to understand my struggles either. Meanwhile, my professors, my current boss, and now an ex-boss/internship lead I had have all been sooo supportive in the ways that I feel I need it most. Partially through their words of ""I've been there too"" but also the sharing of opportunities and recommended reading. But it doesn't fix everything. 

The worst part is that I don't feel I can lean on my family for emotional support either. As soon as I'm within earshot of them, they have to unload their complaints and negative views about the world around them. Its like complaining is their native language. I try to stay optimistic and see the light at the end of the tunnel, but there's certain places/activities (like drinking) I actively avoid to keep my sense of optimism and self out of trouble and repeated patterns. 

\--- --- ---

IDK. Speaking of which, I've got math homework thats due soon so I need to go now. Thanks for reading. Also, I get it now why folks here and in other subs have been talking so much about burnout, mental health/fatigue, etc. It's catching up to me finally and I'm making small changes as I go. 

&#x200B;

TLDR: my family is blindly supportive/happy that I'm going to school but also don't care to ask how things are going while also asking me for help for random small tasks. My professors/boss have been supportive in other ways but it's not a complete fix.

514,"I hate ""performing under pressure""",30,"For context, I was never good at operating under pressure when I was in high school. I was always ""gifted"" and school was just super easy for me, so it was never really stressful. College changed that big-time for me. On top of dealing with much trickier curriculum, I had to learn how to navigate the endless bullshit and bureaucracy of higher education, deal with the fact that I have a 1+ hour commute bc I can't afford to live on campus (fuck being poor), and on top of all of that I had to figure out how to be an adult for the first time. My first semester, I changed my major three days in and dropped a foreign language course as it had constant homework and I was just really stressed out and needed room to breathe and adjust. Well that bit me in the ass because my scholarship requires a certain amount of credits per year so I had to retake it in the summer. On top of working full-time (plus overtime), I had to learn 15 weeks worth of a foreign language in four weeks. The homework was not any easier, and in fact it was literally the same amount of assignments as the 15 week course, just with way less time to do it in. 

 The way my schedule worked out, I only had two days per week that I could do any kind of school work. The way the course was structured, there were usually 2-4 assignments due per day, not including quizzes or exams (the exams were done over zoom and had to be scheduled). So I wound up doing anywhere from ten to fifteen assignments in two days, plus quizzes and exams, every week for four weeks straight. I had several panic attacks, barely ate throughout the week and then binge ate out of stress when my body couldn't take the hunger anymore, and the worst part of all was that I couldn't go to therapy that month because I literally had no time, which meant I just had to thug that shit out on my own. 

The crazy part? I passed. With an A. I had the highest grade in the class. After the ""semester"", the professor told me he was rather impressed with my ""time management"" (from his perspective, I did a week or more's worth of work in a matter of two days every week), so I told him about my circumstances. He said he felt sorry that it was so stressful, but followed it up by saying, ""well, at least you learned how to perform under pressure.""

If I ever have to perform like that again, I think I'll actually just blow my own brains out.

I’m going to cry if I get a B, because to get into the MD schools In my state, I need around a 3.7 at least. It’s just infuriating when me and friends are talking about grades, and they refuse to realize, if I don’t try my hardest, my degree will be pretty useless (a bio degree can’t get me anywhere but research jobs without a high GPA). They also refuse to understand that I’ll get kicked out of my program for a 3.0 or lower. So yes, last semester when I got a 3.5, I was upset. And people take me being upset over that as an insult to them if they got lower, because apparently if I feel stupid, that’s like calling them stupid. The only people that seem to understand are other STEM people, people who want to go to med, vet, dental or PA school, or degrees like psych, and any other humanities degree that basically requires grad school to get good money. I know people will find this vent annoying, but sometimes school is so so much more than just getting a degree, and I will be frustrated when I get a B, not only because it’ll lower my GPA, but because when I’m sacrificing most of my college years just to study, it’s heartbreaking knowing I could be better, and the competition between students is really rough. I get that one C won’t kill me, but certain classes, if I get a C or lower for my major, I will have to retake.

I worked my butt off on our second assignment, and I know I did well on it because it was fairly easy to understand and do.

And I was so proud because I turned it in 3 days early so I wouldn’t stress over it any more. But I just got my grade on Sunday and was floored to see he only graded the graphs I made for the assignment. He gave me a 10/50 - that’s what it says on Canvas.

The assignment was to be done in Excel - graphs and various answers to other questions as well. I did that.
But he didn’t see them. So I sent him an explanation of specifically what cells the answers were in on Excel, screenshots of them on my computer, as well as offering to resend the answers in a Word document.

His response was “I don’t understand. And I have to grade students fairly based on their effort and work.”

I responded back a half-hour ago saying I understood he has to be fair, and I respect his decision, but I did the work, told him again where the answers were in the original document, and that I would make sure the answers showed up in the next one.

But I’m just so stressed now because I’ve read reviews from his past college courses and he’s apparently short-tempered and takes anger out on students, so now I’m worried I’m going to fail the course - and I can’t drop it because it’s required and he’s the only one who teaches it.

I’m thinking I shouldn’t have said anything and just taken the failing grade despite doing the work. I don’t know what to do.

TL;DR: Professor failed my assignment because he didn’t “see the answers” and won’t look through original document to fix grade. I’m stressed over it.

Update: We got it resolved. Apparently I wasn’t the only student having issues with the assignment showing up in Canvas. Canvas had a weird glitch and most students’ assignments weren’t showing up properly, so I got on a call with him because I was the most persistent student (thank you anxiety for the persistence) and seemed to know how to fix the issue. He just needed to download the assignment as an Excel file instead of looking at them through Canvas. He thanked me for the help and will be fixing my grade to reflect the work I did, as well as other students’. Thanks for everyone keeping my head on and giving advice.

524,Too many students - not enough housing,23,"I am so irritating with my school.

We have had an influx of new students and built 3 new buildings for them. Firstly, they made no new parking lots so parking is a nightmare due to freshman being allowed to bring their cars. 

On top of that, more students are expected to be coming in, and anyone who is not forced to live on campus for residency is not guaranteed or expected to get a dorm room.

I CANNOT afford an apartment nor can I commute. How the hell am I supposed to go to school if ya’ll refuse to make enough dorms to support the students that need it. I’ll be here likely 2-3 more years and I can’t even get a dorm room to stay in wtf.

I’m now in my second semester of senior year and honestly idk what I want to do after graduation. Like I have some jobs in mind but I don’t even have a car right now or money to buy a car which feels like a set back. But I need a car before the job. 

Also Idek where I want to live (back in my boring hometown where the job market is limited) or expensive apartments in the area I go to college. My relationship is in a weird place too where we are long distance and trying to move in together but that makes me figuring out my own stuff much more complicated. 

I also want to go to grad school but honestly I don’t know when. For my field it’s kind of mandatory for a decent paying job. A bachelors in psych doesn’t get you very high paying jobs. 

I also have to pay loans when I graduate 😭 I don’t get any financial support from family so I’m just so stressed. 

I feel like I need to have it figured out, like I don’t want to have a degree but work in retail. I feel like I get told that I can take my time to find a job, but at the same time people look down on college grads working in retail or minimum wage. 

I feel like at least rn I can have a sense of feeling like I’m advancing myself and career while in school, but when I graduate I don’t want to feel stagnant. My family seems to want me to have it figured out soon but idkkkk",peepeepoopaccount

531,"Old highschool taking forever to send my transcripts, delaying my transfer process.",7,"I know it's weird for a college to require you to send in highschool transcripts when you're transferring with an associates, but one of my colleges I'm looking at does require them to look at your application, and my highschool is taking their sweet, sweet time sending them. Called them early this month, then called them again about a week afterwards, to which the counselor said I was ""in line"". How I'm in line despite the highschool having a senior class of like, 50 people max in it and it being a super rural area where most people don't go to college (completely fine btw), I have no clue. 

So, I was like ""Ok, take your time"", because I'm not about to piss off someone I need something from, but it's now been almost four whole weeks of waiting for these stupid transcripts to send out. Surely it cannot take that long to send a paper out, especially if it's electronic? I really don't want to call them again and keep bothering them, but it's really screwing me up not being able to consider my options because one college needs my highschool transcripts to ""verify"" the fact that I graduated, even though me being in college is basically verification itself because you need a diploma to get admitted??

I would've applied earlier if I'd known that this school needed high school transcripts, and I recognize it's partially my fault, but none of the other colleges I've looked into require it, so it took me a bit off guard and I wasn't prepared for it. I'm accepted into another state school, but they're not offering much scholarship wise, and this particular school has a lot of help for transfers.

We're also in a choir room so it just echos and the class is 2 hours long. And unfortunately, math is one of those subjects that need to be clear (or maybe that's just me bc I don't get it). Obviously, they cant NOT hire someone bc of their accent (that's discrimination) but it's just very frustrating as the student sometimes. I don't even ask questions bc I'm worried I won't understand the answer.

Quiet whispering is fine imo, but literally talking loudly like as if we’re in a high school cafeteria is not okay.  Even when the professor yells “EXCUSE ME” at them because they’re being loud, they’re just so unaware that they keep talking. It’s beyond frustrating and I can’t switch classes because of scheduling issues. I just want to learn.

541,I am SO done with mandatory attendance,432,"For the past 3 (finishing my bachelor and doing my masters) I lived 2.5h away from the university where I study. Before you say something, know that I am an older student, I have a family and both my partner and I already had jobs in the city where we live, so it was difficult to say at least. 

By far the most difficult thing was mandatory attendance. I needed to travel 5h (back and forth) ,2 times a week and pay a lot of money for a 2h course that I cannot even place full value on, because my capacity to fully focus in a class environment is quite limited (I have ADHD) and also it was hard for me to relate to my classmates, who are younger. My only luck was that, for all these years, in every course I took, only the practicals were mandatory, but never the lectures, so I was able to group those out together and minimise my travel time and maximise my study time at home.  

Finally, after almost 6 years, I am in my final semester. The last 6 months have been extremely difficult and I was so looking forward to take my last 4 classes and leave this behind. 

But guess what? The only 4 courses I have to take in my last semester are THE ONLY courses that have mandatory presence for both lectures and practicals...which are spread on every single day of the week, from 9 in the morning. For my last semester, I will have to travel 5h back and fourth every single day.

542,“Just because my dreams are different than yours doesn’t mean they’re unimportant.”,36,"I think this quote from *Little Women* really sums up the college experience. Everyone is so judgmental about what people major in, especially when it comes to how much money they will make or how difficult the courses are. But I’d argue all majors are important. We need history majors so we don’t forget history and repeat it. We need art majors to create art so the world isn’t boring (we all like to watch movies and TV after a long day, right?). Even if your degree won’t make you a lot of money, you’ll still contribute something important to the world. Not everyone can be a STEM major. And don’t get me wrong, STEM majors are SUPER important in our society (we have a lot of STEM people to thank for helping us through COVID-19). But it’s stupid to shame people for their majors. Just think: the same people you shame for being an art major could illustrate your future child’s favorite picture book. You never know what someone’s future will hold.

544,AI Flag Follow-up and Advisor Recommendations,6,"INFO: I am an undergrad academic/career advisor.

A while back I commented on a post regarding AI writing flags, which you can find here: [**LINK**](https://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeRant/comments/14dnu8v/comment/jourb6p/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

**TLDR:** Student got an AI writing flag and had to speak with their instructor to ""prove"" they wrote an original final essay. I recommend tracking writing revisions and versions to avoid issues like these in the future.

**POST:** More recently in the Fall 2023 semester, one of my students had an ugly run-in with an AI writing flag on turnitin (the plagiarism checker). The instructor runs the paper for plagiarism first and for AI writing second, and then shares feedback and concerns with the student.

In this particular case, the student received a normal plagiarism score (including citations and all). Unfortunately, they also got a high AI writing score (indicating they used something like ChatGPT to write). The student maintained to me and the faculty member that they wrote a purely original final paper over the course of several weeks.

In the end I did end up speaking with the faculty, though that is not normal practice, and I learned a bit more about the AI flag feature. Apparently it's quite new and some faculty are still learning about it themselves, and I'm sure the folks at turnitin are working out the kinks based on faculty and student feedback. The instructor told me that they were following up with each student individually if there was a flag, and as I understand it that follow-up was more a conversation and check-in than grilling students for facts.

*However,* I would be remiss if I didn't make suggestions to college students! So here they are:

1. First and foremost, **keep notes about your writing/sources and track changes** in Microsoft Word or Google Docs. This will be one of the most certain ways to prove an original work. Docs shows changes and checking those is usually pretty simple. Word has a setting or two that lets you track changes, and showing that as a visual can show that you wrote and revised rather than copied and pasted.
2. If you are flagged for AI writing, **try not to panic**! I believe that most faculty, at least at the present, are going to be open to speaking with students about this. If you don't have a history of plagiarism or academic dishonesty, there shouldn't be any reason to believe you've suddenly started using AI to write your essays.
3. **Do your best** ***not*** **to use things like Grammarly** or ChatGPT or whatever to write and revise your paper. It's fine for a cover letter, less so for a 15 page research paper. Write, reread, revise, and use on-campus resources like tutoring/writing centers. Find a peer, a staff member, or another faculty member who wouldn't mind occasionally reading what you have and giving feedback.
4. **Communicate openly and frequently!** I can't tell you how many times I hear from students that things are not going well after it's already too late. When you have a concern, please share it with someone.

Most institutions have a grade dispute policy outlined in their undergraduate catalog. You can usually find that by googling ""(school name) undergrad catalog,"" though it may have a different name (bulletin, handbook, policy manual, something like that). As a rule, your advisor will not be able to help with a grade dispute - it is typically solely between the faculty and the student, but your catalog will provide an explanation specific to you.

If you have questions or stories of your own, please share them!",CourageousKiwi
545,I have no idea how people handle five classes a semester and have a life,632,"I’ve had 4-5 classes a semester most of my college life. I get mostly As, but I have no idea how this is a sustainable lifestyle. I have almost no life outside of studying hard, then burning out, then studying hard again. I don’t know how people go about being involved in clubs and extracurriculars and having an active social life without sacrificing their grades. Is there something I’m missing? I know I could try to plan my time better, but I never end up following the plans I set for myself. I feel like maybe I’m not built for college, or such a busy life in general… I’ll try again to schedule my time better, and maybe that will help. I just want this cycle of burnout to end.

TLDR: how do people consistently juggle five classes and have a life? 

EDIT: I appreciate all the feedback :) 

My major has moved around a lot over the years, but right now my classes are all in Linguistics or Language-related. I don’t think it’s as much work as STEM program, but it’s not like. Well, business. 

I actually went and talked to people at my uni about this issue and pinpointed the issue a bit:

1) I think I’m putting too much pressure on myself to get all As. I should put my mental and physical health first even if that means my grades go down. Cause that’s not the end of the world. And honestly, it might even improve my grades…but that’s not the main reason I should prioritize my mental health. It’s just a possible side effect. 

2) Better time management is good, but that also means spending a more reasonable amount of time on my assignments. I spend a lot of time making my assignments “perfect” but with even a fraction of that effort I could probably still get a good grade (A or B). (Not all As are equal). 

3) I’m going to talk to my professors a lot more… I have some accommodations for ADHD, and I’ve been to all my professors’ office hours to discuss them. I’ve also got along with all my professors, and I know to communicate with them beforehand if I’m struggling with class, so I’m fairly sure they will be understanding. 

4) I still don’t know about the social life thing… but I found the time to go to a couple club info sessions. I think having a good schedule and sticking to it—spending a more reasonable amount of time on assignments, even if that means they are not perfect—will give me more time later in the day to go to clubs.

5) It is still going to be a lot of work. Because it’s college. But I’m in a major that I find interesting, so I’ll try to find fun in it, even if it’s a lot of work.

548,Is it really worth going to graduate school for passion?,8,"So, I have somewhat of a love-hate relationship with my school. There have been countless incidents that I've experienced that make me question what I'm even doing at the undergraduate level, and numerous other moments made me go, ""Oh shit, this is kind of interesting; I want to know more."" 

&#x200B;

I guess the story starts in Fall 2021, when I decided to major in Computer Science, as I was interested in getting an IT career before and didn't exactly care about what I was learning, and more career focused. I was applying to FAANG posts I was applying to internships & career events. I was even excited to renew my contract for the university and plan out my entire career based on working in IT for the next four years. Unfortunately, things did not pan out the way they did, and I gradually started to harbor some resentment that was boiling before I went to undergrad, and it just snowballed from there. I didn't renew my contract, so I took summer classes to graduate earlier. I applied to various places around my local internships & careers events - to this day, my total count is well over a thousand applied posts. I had career guidance counselors, Reddit, experienced managers, and every Tom, Dick, and Harry look at my resumes, and still nothing. The only recommendation that stings was when a career guidance counselor (who was later fired for Title IX violation) told me to change my name and to act more ""diligent,"" and I had no idea what the fuck to do. Not to mention the hostile work environment I was in, but looking back, it was probably some form of toughening up. It got to me, and I started shifting my plans toward graduating faster even more and trying to get any internships I could. 

&#x200B;

Then, January of 2022 happened, and I realized the industry that I wanted to join was imploding before my eyes, and layoffs after layoffs hit the streets. In hindsight, I should've known that the field was imploding judging by the number of CS majors quadrupling (even though our school has the most business and nursing majors, CS is quickly reaching the third and probably will overtake business majors). At this time, I decided to take more math-intensive courses during the semester and found out that I enjoyed some aspects of it. I started taking more math-intensive courses to the point where I declared a minor. I planned on turning it into a major, but unfortunately, a bad experience with a precalculus instructor made me feel like I had burned that bridge. The classes they offered at the time had limited seating, and I didn't want to burden the other math education & math majors, so I kept finishing my course load. 

&#x200B;

Then, in July 2023, I started to feel some weird pain and found out that I had a medical problem and that I needed to get the surgery done. Otherwise, there could be a possibility it could spread to the rest of my body. I thought about postponing the semester, but then I realized I'd need to finish this semester, as the money recovery isn't worth the effort to fight. It tells you how fucked up funding has gotten to the point where I need to put myself at health risk if I want to continue receiving it. But what was done is done, and I got the surgery, and that was when I started to question myself, so I picked philosophy out of sheer desperation, and I began to enjoy the courseload as well. Unfortunately, or fortunately, there isn't a philosophy major so that I can graduate earlier. Still, it sucks that I can't do anything but either graduate a semester later or two, compared to had I graduated a full year earlier. 

&#x200B;

Regardless, I am not sure as to what to do now. My CS professors are OK with me, and I know two professors who are willing to be my LORs, but I'm still questioning whether or not it is worth continuing. The problem stems from the fact that while I'm not the only one, I want to go into a system that doesn't give a fuck about me aside from my academic performance (3.3 GPA from 3.7 GPA, really telling how bad that pre-surgery medical problem has affected me), and my research abilities? Do I want to go into a field where it wouldn't guarantee me in terms of anything beyond, at best, a 10-15% raise over my beginning salary in my field and, at worst, leaving me with increased student debt on top of the medical debt that I now have? Is it worth learning for passion when I must start paying off this debt? 

&#x200B;

I guess the moral of the story is that learning what I want to know (upper-level mathematic concepts and Hellenistic-era philosophy) is not going to pay the bill compared to doing CRUD works over and over again for pay that I could've gotten had I became an electrician and worked my way up to journeyman. Sure, I can earn more money going over to places like NYC, but is it worth the sacrifices?

560,"Good lord, what am I even GETTING out of this.",78,"This is my third year in community college. I started in an accelerated program my junior year of highschool. I still have 1½ - 2 years left before I can even transfer. Even after I transfer, that's still multiple MORE years of HARDER school. That costs way more on top of that. Outside of school, I work full time. 

I don't feel like I get anything out of school. I love the classes and class discussions themselves, but the second I get homework or projects or ANYTHING else that eats up the very, very little time I have for myself (mostly time I really need to SLEEP) I just get so down and miserable. I become like a shell of myself because I'm too tired and moody to function. And not working isn't an option because I need to pay for my car (around $500 a month for gas/tolls/insurance) and groceries and I need to put money into savings to pay for classes since I'm not getting money from my parents. And sometimes I want to buy myself something enjoyable because depriving myself of anything fun for 6 or 7 years straight would just make the problem worse.

I don't even really know what my end goals are other than to be done with it. I'm just getting a degree because my family says I have to (except for my mom, who also dropped out, but she's been working at a grocery store for the past 20 years). Neither of my parents graduated. And I can see why. This fucking sucks.

If it matters, I'm getting an English degree. Only thing I can tolerate taking this many classes in. Also well rounded(ish) because all employers appreciate someone who can write well, read well, and talk well.

TLDR; I feel like this is a waste of time and money and I don't even know what I'm doing all of this for.

EDIT: I tallied up the classes I left left to cover for my major requirements and IGETC. It's 8 classes left. I can do that in either 2 full semesters as long as at least two of the classes (or an IGETC equivalent) get offered over a summer or winter session. Or, I could do that in 3 semesters with one semester only having a 2-class load. So I have a year to a year and a half of schooling left before I can transfer.",goldensunbath
561,It's my final semester of undergrad and I've lost all interest in my major - what do I do?,15,"I majored in Advertising, thinking that's what I wanted to do with my life, but after a year and a half of working as a film programmer at our campus cinema, I've discovered a world of film distribution and festival circuits that interests me much more. This is a field that requires no specialized education - as long as you have a college degree. I hear this and think, ""Well, if my degree could've been in anything, why didn't I choose something I was more passionate about?""

I chose Advertising my freshman year because I enjoyed doing publicity for my high school plays (promotion, graphic design, social media, etc.), However, Adveritisng as a major is more like a four-year internship than an educational program as there is very little ""academia"" involved. I do not feel ""college-educated,"" but rather, I have experience creating mock campaigns for mock clients, which I could've gained in the real world. My minor, General Business, was also a complete waste of time. Asynchronous online classes are a scam for me as I cannot retain anything I learned, despite passing every class I took with flying colors and earnest efforts.

My other minor is in Film Studies, the only program I wholeheartedly enjoyed. I've been a cinephile since middle school, and unlocking the thematic and practical dimensions of the medium feels very rewarding. My interest in film (and my hobby of making YouTube videos) makes me regret not majoring in Digital Media Production so I could work my way around industry-standard equipment and be around creative people. Last year I also started pursuing languages, as my father is a polyglot, and I regret not going down that avenue sooner. 

I'm typing this out after returning from the university job and internship fair. I scanned my ID at the entrance, and it automatically printed a card that read ""\[Name\] - Advertising - Senior."" My heart sank a bit as I read it, and further when the only booths interested in me were generic and soulless ad agencies.

Thankfully I did well enough in high school to qualify for Florida's Bright Futures program, so I wasted very little of my own money doing this. As for what to do, I realize grad school is on the table, but I've always been a ""don't look back"" kind of person. I feel a drive to simply start my life instead of extending my adolescence in the pursuit of more degrees. I guess I'm asking if any of my fellow seniors or post-grads feel this way too.

567,How do I detach my academic ability from my personal value?,40,"I'm currently a junior in college. 

Before college, I made the grave mistake of tying down my identity to my academics, and I believe this partially came from the desire of wanting to be successful to make my parents proud because they are immigrants. I'm not a complete ""try hard"" as I am an easygoing person, I'd say I'm sociable and humorous but I don't keep close friends and I stick to my boundaries. My one questionable boundary is with academics now though. 

During the first semester of my freshman year, one of my family members became bedridden and there was always tension and sadness at home (I commute btw, I live just over an hour from campus). During the beginning of the spring semester of my sophomore year, my family member passed away. During this period, my grades dropped and I had to financially support myself and my family so I worked a bunch of hours and consequently my grades dropped. I failed and retook a couple of classes and I was determined to make an academic comeback. But it has been super discouraging for me because I tied down my value as a person to my academics and my grades had dropped. I tried doing things that were meaningful to bounce back from this, like getting a better job, lowering my hours, and volunteering within my community. But deep down I know my grades might hold me back from getting into grad programs because I want to go to optometry school. I'm still very adamant about pursuing the field and right now I am doing everything I can to get to my academic comeback but the doubt at the back of my head lingers.

568,Pearson Mylab for stats is actually the worst,33,"This is my first stats class in pearson (my other was in Aleks, and I actually didn't hate it too much?) and dear god is it the worst program I've ever used in my life. I've had to use mylab in a few other classes, but this section on distribution frequencies is killing me. 

The work in and of itself isn't hard, don't get me wrong. It's just basic stats and is really just a review of a former stats class I've already taken. It's the sheer number of parts to every. single. problem. that is killing me. They're all like 12 parts long and require so many tedious, monotonous little calculations. You have to transport the numbers into excel or pearson's own little excel ripoff to sort the numbers because of *course* they don't do it for you, do the frequency distribution chart, make x type of graph relating to the chart, then do the relative frequency chart, do another graph, do the cumulative charts for both the frequency and the relative charts, then do MORE graphs for both of those charts, and then answer whatever bullshit question they feel necessary to ask. 

The HW is only 21 questions, but in reality it's 21 questions with 12+ parts to them, so it's more like 250+ smaller questions. God help you if you mess up and make a simple rounding mistake or don't see the fraction of a hair's difference between two graphs and click the wrong one.

572,Over it 😑,18,"TL;DR: My college keeps screwing up and leaving it for me to figure out. 

I'm really starting to get sick of this place. Every time I turn around they're screwing something up and making it my problem to fix it.

The first time it happened was at the beginning of this spring semester. I went out of my way to register for all of my courses earlier in the fall semester so I wouldn't have to scramble right before the next semester started. They canceled the course 2 days before the start of the semester. Leaving me to figure out what the hell I was going to do in order to get my credit hours and find a course that still had open seats on that short of notice.

On their latest episode of nonsense the registration system keeps dropping my courses, almost a month into the semester, dropped two of my courses and will not let me add them back.

So now I get the joy of calling the office in the morning and dealing with a situation that I never should have had to deal with. I went out of my way to handle all of my class registration early. This should not be happening. And it definitely shouldn't be my problem to figure out. I did everything that I was supposed to. Fix your stupid system 😮‍💨🤦🏽‍♀️",EmoGamingGirl
573,2 days in and im already stressed over nothing,9,"Just wanted to vent about my current situation haha

&#x200B;

I'm a college sophomore, with severe ADHD, social anxiety and OCD, and am like 2 days into the spring semester and have gotten all my syllabi. Failed one class freshman year (prof assigned homework without telling anyone about it) and got straight As last semester except one class which I failed because I stupidly missed the final despite working super hard in this class. I've been beating myself up all winter break, and have had to take 20 credits to keep my scholarship and need to raise my GPA from 2.9 to have a chance at grad school. The workload so far isn't completely terrible considering I have a class that only meets once a week and 2 cool profs I've already had (and most of these classes are in subjects I actually love), but I'm somehow overwhelmed and still in a constant state of stress. I'm going to retake the class I failed last fall during the upcoming fall semester, but I still feel like I have a stain that will never go away.

 I feel like I have to reach an impossible standard to prove myself worthy of remaining in college (I'm also a 1st gen student from poor immigrant parents, so the pressure is on and I have little guidance on what to do at all), I haven't done any internships or """"networking"""" in my degree despite knowing it's hard to obtain internships in my field until I'm a junior or senior, my parents are encouraging me to get a summer job to pay for college, I need to start inquiring about study abroad and worrying about how to pay for it, I can't even bring myself to check my email because I'm afraid something horrible will pop up because I forgot to do something, and I still have to scrounge up enough money to pay for textbooks. 

My extracurriculars (I'm in 2 clubs, and am on the executive board for one) are fun, but even when I don't have anything to do and am relaxing I'll feel guilty about my past failures or not working on something at the moment. I feel like a failure and like I haven't figured anything out, and that if I make one mistake that I'll crash and ruin everything.

TL;DR: I like school but everything is overwhelming. I want to believe everything will be alright.

Even in my group for the schools media I'm in for only work study, none of the other people there aside from like 2 people are people I'd hang with so I feel like the odd one out whenever there are group meetings or whatever.

575,I don't understand why some students complain so much...,71,"I usually join groupchats for my classes, and the things people say in them are crazy sometimes. Now, I'm the first person to complain if a professor or TA is being unfair or ineffective in their teaching, but some other students seem to be in a different reality. 

For instance, the midwest (where I am) is currently experiencing some horrible weather, and many schools, including mine, have closed. We switched to online, and a TA for my lab emailed us and just said to complete the assignment by the regular time (we didn't even have a meeting!). And people still complained about that! I mean, they aren't just going to not give you the assignment... I have issues with this TA but this is generous compared to how he usually is.

Or in another class, the professor gives people the option to attend class entirely through zoom *or* in person, and he makes it engaging regardless. I always struggled in online classes, but somehow he makes it work for me with how amazingly he teaches it. And he is super lenient on deadlines (even told us to not hesitate to go to bed and submit assignments the next morning if we need to, and not to stay up all night). He is one of the best professors I've ever had. And still, a couple lectures ago, someone had the *audacity* to ask him in the zoom chat when he was wrapping up if they could go eat dinner... like do they not think that's rude at *all*??? You're on zoom! You can literally just go eat if you're that hungry and no one would know!

Like I said, I'm the *first* person to complain if a professor is genuinely doing something wrong. I've left my share of harsh student feedback evaluations. But some people *actually* just want a damn handout...",wt_anonymous
576,Our university had two suicides last week...,1289," 

And it has changed the way, I view the campus as a comfort place. It feels so grey and immensely hopeless here. I can't talk to anyone about these feelings because it's selfish and makes a loss about myself. So I thought I'd vent here.

I'm a freshman at university, and it has been a vast adjustment. I have developed a few unhealthy habits like overtly obsessing over things. One that is beginning to consume my life is a very strange preoccupation with other people's problems, like I feel anxious when I see someone get a bad grade, or stop caring about classes. These people are complete strangers, and yet I spend random significant amounts of time just worrying about their academics, their mental health, idk.

And now last week, two people just committed suicide and it has been on my mind every moment. I don't know these people, I don't have a reason to grieve them, hell I'm not even a sensitive person. Yet I can't stop imagining their emotional turmoil, the mental hell they would have been in.

What's worse is that before I even knew about these suicides, only the night before I had a nightmare where some friend of mine was trying to kill themselves and dream me idiotically left a cutter lying around, using which they killed themselves on top of some random building. Then I woke up in tears only to see a message from a classmate that someone killed themselves by slitting their wrists. I know it's a horrible horrible coincidence, but I don't quite feel well after all of this and I just wanted to vent a little. Thats it.

I'm significantly older than a vast majority of my classmates by 15+ years (though most people cant seem to tell from just looking; classmates are always surprised when i reveal my age and tell me they thought I was only a few years older than them). As a result, sometimes it feels really hard to fit into any groups. I feel like an ""other"". I feel like my classmates sometimes think I am an  ""other"".

I had an atypical life path and it took me a very long time to get back on the horse. I have my own friends who are closer to my age range, as well as a few younger ones that I made in community college a few years back. I also have a domestic partner of 4 years, so I do not believe I am struggling socially. But when I am on campus, it seems hard to socialize with my classmates in a meaningful way. I know we're here to learn, but lets not pretend like many of us dont want to make friends in college. I see groups of my classmates who are always together and hanging out with each other. Sometimes I'll find myself socializing with them a bit, and I've even joined clubs related to my major, but it still feels like I'm kept at arms length. I dont think they are particularly wary of me. I can regularly and effortlessly make people laugh. And not like nervous laughter. Most of the friends I make here, we end up losing contact when the semester let's out. And not for lack of trying. But it's fine I suppose. They have their own lives and careers to attend to. I also understand this is fairly normal in college. I myself can get swept up in research in-between semesters (I want a career in academia), which takes up a huge portion of my free time. So I get it.

I don't know if I'm seeking advice, or just venting. But I do feel quite lonely at the moment, and it affects my motivation to study sometimes...

584,College has completely ruined my relationship with my sister,28,"I have a twin sister, and although we have always had a tumultuous relationship, dorming together has dismantled it completely. 

I've always been a pushover to her, she knows how to manipulate me and use me to her benefit. She knows I'll do whatever for her, because I'm soft. I used to think that doing this would make her like me, or at least appreciate me, but I've been so wrong. She has never cared about me. 

Over the last couple of months, she's shown me how much of a true uncaring bitch she is, at least to me. She will not do anything for me, not even the simplest of things. I have to beg, to plea, to bribe, to get everything, even though she walks all over me. I spent over a hundred of our campus dollars on her, just to get her to listen to me. 

I do everything for her basically. I clean the room, I take out the trash, I carry her heavy laundry, I get her food when she wants it (otherwise she won't eat, and I feel bad). She says this is justified because she drives me everywhere, as I am not a comfortable driver and have little experience driving in the city where we go to school.  I understand this is a large burden, especially since we live far away from college and go home on weekends, but she uses this as a leverage over me, and as a way to belittle me and call me names. She knows I hate to drive, and treats me like shit for it. 

As for names, she loves to call me stupid. She probably calls me stupid everyday, over everything. She also says I'm annoying, and generally hates being around me and talking to me. Even before college and living together, she told me that even just me being around her frustrates her. Not to mention she is incredibly insecure and full of herself, and I have to constantly tell her she looks good, otherwise she will get upset, and say that she will kill herself. I have also spent the last 8 years hearing everything about Kpop and the anime that she likes, but she will never listen to what I like, and I don't even bother. 

Last semester I caught her eating my cereal, and told her repeatedly not to eat it, but she didn't care. I became distraught and cried over it, because it's what I eat every morning, and because it was just an act of her double standers. I knew that if she caught me eating her food, she would have become physical with me, yet she acted like she didn't give a fuck that it was my cereal, and that she was entitled to it. I admit, in retrospect I was dramatic, but it just showed me how much she really didn't care how I felt. 

When I get upset that she won't listen to me, or won't understand were I'm coming from, she just tells me that she doesn't care, and to stfu over and over. I just have to give up to her every time. 

We have been back to school for less than a week, and I have already cried twice because of her. Just today, and the reason I'm writing this, I asked her to get a bag out of the car for me because the sidewalk was slick with ice, and I was afraid to fall, as I have fallen and broken my wrist from it before. She was already going back to the car, so it was simple for her to grab it, but naturally she didn't, and wouldn't listen to me when I was obviously upset. It just hurts because I would have gotten it for her, if our roles were swapped. I don't know if she understands this, but It would hurt much worse if she did. 

I highly doubt she would even care if I died, and she has said she wouldn't go to my funeral if I did. But she wouldn't have someone to baby her if I did. 

TL;DR - I have a twin sister, and dorming together has made me realize how much of a heartless bitch she is to me, as she constantly walks all over and uses me. ",RatedEforEnvy
585,How to manage college and my mental state?,6,"I've found every year my mental state declines. I have been doing everything I can think of to boost it, pushing myself to do well in college so I can be proud of myself getting good grades. Taking medication to fix my depression. Going to therapy. Exercising to try and clear my mind. You know all the basics to keep oneself mentally stable. Then there is college something that has been feeling like it has sucked the life out of me.

I have pretty much no friends and I'm in the last year of my degree, didn't get to spend as much time on campus as I had hoped due to covid and such, have imposter syndrome every time I do well, feel like I still know nothing, don't feel like I have anything planned after college and ultimately just feel like I don't know what to do anymore.

I can't just quit college, I have to keep on going. I have not been mentally well since childhood but I pushed myself through primary and secondary school and aim to do the same in college. It has gotten harder but damn I just wish everything wasn't so taxing on me.

587,why do professors do this??,360,"edit: yes i already take notes and i go to class. i said the recordings would help me REINFORCE, not replace my own note taking. 

edit 2: some things that should be noted (i’m putting the edits at the top here so maybe folks will read them lol)!!


- this is not an average college course its a universally difficult math-based engineering course.


- i don’t hate my prof also, i actually really like them. i just happen to be a student who is interested in ACTUALLY understanding the material rather than passing the class. 


- per university policy i need permission to record audio during lecture, which i’ll be asking for next class. thank you to those of yall who understood and gave me some good feedback!! :)


i honestly cannot figure it out. i am a mechanical engineering major. i have this professor this semester for two very difficult classes who seems very knowledgeable but one thing just completely irks me. he said he will never post the lecture notes to canvas. his reasoning is that students will not be inclined to come to class or take notes if he posts them. he is mostly a lecturer so he has very little written notes and it is mostly auditory learning. studies show that you lose a substantial amount of memory as soon as you leave the classroom. it just makes no sense to me why this way of learning has to be the ONLY way. it is NOT my fault that other students might be lazy and fail because they didn’t come to class/go over the posted notes. don’t even get me started on the nightmare it would be if you are sick and are trying to catch up. maybe this is just me, but i learned the absolute best when my professor would record lectures so i could go back and reinforce what i had learned. i just feel that im going to do terrible in my courses this semester simply because i’m not an auditory learner. i would try to switch classes but that is unfortunately not an option. obviously i’ll try my best with the online resources, i just don’t understand this weird sort of collective punishment. had to get that rant out of my system before i got back to class :0

588,Anyone else's profs laying it on thick this semester?,130,"TL;DR Coursework is SUPER heavy as someone who is attending school full-time and working full-time. Not sure why the sudden shift in course workload since last semester was very smooth in expectations and how courses were set up.

I'm currently taking e-campus courses because I work full-time (also going to school full time, 13 credit hours). These profs are crazy. In the Blackboard website they have tabs upon tabs of useless sections on the homepages for their classes, so many that it can be hard to find something they're referencing to look for. The syllabi/course schedules are not fully filled out with the information needed (course schedule I have just says to complete a discussion post with no indication that there's a required response to a peer's discussion post). My computer methods prof is stressing how extremely specifically we need to name assignments when uploading them, because any difference in the name could cause us to get no grade (understandable, but tedious).

For my public speaking class, I have to watch 4 videos with questions to introduce us to the online material, another video to introduce us to the prof and her sort of overview for the class, do all the basic stuff like reading the syllabus, read 3 chapters in the dreaded McGraw-Hill SmartBook (if you don't know what this is, you're very lucky. Basically you have to read the chapter and take an assessment of the chapter information, which could 30+ questions depending on how well you grasp the material. This doesn't sound too bad but), a quiz for each chapter (so 3 total), make a video of our first speech (which needs to be moderately outlined and practiced), then comment on 3 peers' speeches with 5 reactions in the McGraw-Hill website, a critique of their speech on what could be improved, and 2 connections/positives. You also need to look over the rubric for the first speech, watch a video of the prof's explanation of the first speech, and watch a video of an example of the first speech. By the time I'm done with everything it's been like 4 hours give or take, and that was just for this short week because of MLK Jr. Day! This is a level 1000 course, I don't know why the coursework is so plentiful. I'd like to learn what I can, but damn.

Maybe I have no room to complain because I'm a full-time working student, which is gonna be hard in it's own right. I know not everyone going to school works, and if they do, may not be working full-time. All of that work for this one class, coupled with the other work for my other courses (advanced computer methods, accounting, management, and marketing) which is just or almost as plentiful, it's A LOT to do. Mostly just venting here I guess, not understanding why so many of them seem to forget we have other coursework and that, because we're attending online, we probably have other life responsibilities that don't allow us to just go to school on campus.

Edit: I’m not trying to come off as having this expectation online classes were going to be easy or that professors are going to have consistent expectations for classes. I’ve taken online and in person courses at 2 different universities and a community college both pre- and post-pandemic that have shaped my experience and expectations for course workload. 

It seems pretty shitty to me that some people commenting on this post think I don’t have room to complain because I’m working full time and taking full time school. I have no other alternative (I’ll lose funding for school if I go part time, I’ll lose my housing, car, and other things if I work part time; I’ve taken the bare minimum of credits I can that count for full time but also allow me to graduate in a decent amount of time. If I don’t go back to school I’m doomed to the penny pinching I’m doing now, and that’s not an option). I’m allowed to have feelings about school being overwhelming, working full-time or not. I’m allowed to say the coursework this semester is heavier than last semester and it’s weighing on me. I’m also going through some mental health issues (possible PTSD) so it has been a tumultuous start of the semester. 

I simply was wondering if anyone else’s profs had been assigning more work this semester than last. ",carolinethebandgeek

it wasn't until i entered college that i made so many friends even though i was still battling with intense social anxiety. for the first time in my life i have a friend group of people i feel comfortable around and people who want to hang out with me and talk to me and actually like me. i also had my first ever bf in college.

593,"Professor going on strike, no class but work is due",496,"I'm in an online program while I work full time. The professors at my university are going on strike next week. All of my professors will be participating in the strike. Two of them opened next week's assignments early for those of us that want to do them, but nothing is due until after the strike. 

One teacher has said that he will be turning off the class so we cannot access it, but that we still need to do and turn in our work. How are we suppose to turn in our work if we can't access the class? He also didn't post in the syllabus what the work is for each week so I don't know what I need to do and turn in. 

It will be available today, and tomorrow the strike starts. So I either need to do an entire week's worth of reading and course work today and turn it in, or hope that the strike ends before work is due. Otherwise my work will be considered late. He has to understand that this is not fair right?

594,Was it a good idea that my professor made the test so students could not go back to old questions?,20,"Hi all. I first heard about this about 2 years ago. The professor said to do teaching evals because that tells them how to improve their class. They mentioned that teaching evals convinced them they should let students go to old questions. That was the case for the exams for the semester before I took the class.

I honestly thought she was lying when she said that. Not going back to old questions sounds like a terrible idea to me. For those exams, there would be \~ 20 easy questions and \~ 5 hard questions. The questions would be in random order, so I would skip the hard ones and answer all the easy questions. Then, look at the hard ones and see which ones I could solve.

But I had a prof last year who made the restriction that students cannot go back to old questions. Their logic was that it helps to avoid cheating, but I don't know. I feel like it causes more confusion. Sometimes, I have skipped questions by accident.",Terrible_Exchange653

I have NO HOLDS on my account, yet the registration office dropped all my classes because I cannot see any of them on the student website. I emailed the reg office as well as student accounts, explaining the situation and I am awaiting a response, but I am so frustrated. I really need those classes that I chose for this upcoming semester. I don't want to be screwed out of the classes me and my advisor chose for me due to an error they may have made on their end, especially when I did everything on time and let the school know. I am also frustrated because money is involved. I'm so upset rn and I wish I could call them later today rather than wait for an email but it's the weekend. Someone, please reassure me that they may have made a mistake cuz I literally did everything in my power to prevent this from happening.

TL;DR: My school dropped all my courses for the upcoming semester despite me taking all the precautions to prevent them from doing so and I fear I am screwed. 

UPDATE: After getting an email back from student accounts, I found out that I’ve been dismissed from the university until I bring my GPA back up to the minimum. It really sucks that I just found out especially because I just set up a payment plan. I think they may refund me but I’m not sure.

598,"I'm tired, and apathetic to everything, not sure what to do with my future now.",4,"It's been a while since I've been on here, but at this point, I'm not even sure what the fuck I am doing. For background context and unnecessary bullshit of credentialism that I feel is ruining society as a whole -- I am currently an undergraduate senior in Computer Science with a minor in math and now a minor in philosophy. I'm 20 years old, about to turn 21 in about the next five months, and I'm jobless after taking on three jobs last semester. 

My academic background is essentially me bumbling through all my classes starting in Fall 2021; However, there was once a genuine interest and passion I had for computer science and mathematics as a whole - now I want to turn into a Luddite and live on a farm without anybody else to talk to aside from that one village in Switzerland where I can barter foods and supplies, without ever wondering what the time complexity of traversing a multidimensional array is, nor wondering what the difference between logistic regression vs. linear regression, nor how to do a triple integral of a sphere in cartesian coordinates is. I understand that going to university is a privilege and that I should be fortunate enough that I am not in the same standing as my cousins, many of whom in my birth countries are struggling with food, much less education. But there's also a lot of societal bullshits that I am facing as of now in a place where I don't feel like I belong anywhere either. 

I guess the combination of a couple of personal attacks of a particular disposition, especially after recent attacks, and growing up with a sense of being the ""other"" has left me with a jaded mindset that I am not sure I can even really cure. Not to mention recent safety as a whole from medical reasoning for a recent surgery that I am still healing from that may bankrupt me before student loans even get into the equation, as well as faced with familial issues as stresses and abuses get to us, and me being essentially a political tool in this day and age, it makes me wonder as to what is the point of anything related to intellectualism when there's a good chance that I couldn't even enjoy nor face reality with it. It isn't as if we had a culture that celebrates intellectualism, so much so in the mixed immigrant culture I grew up with (although, in fairness, we are more focused on meeting the end, not the process in terms of education).

Not to mention, I don't think academia is a good path toward future financial success, not at least anymore. It's essentially exploitation of the scarcity principle, where too many people default to go to college when, in actuality, the skills and intellectualism they are learning are effectively going to waste in terms of career prospects unless they have a slim chance of doing additional stuff (REUs, Internships, Clubs, etc.), and even then its just the beginning of their career, not the whole pathway to a career as a whole, which may be strife with layoffs as we've seen in countless industries. Now, there was a chance that I could've gone in for money back when I was 17 choosing my college, but that died when I didn't get into the college that would've guaranteed me that, and I just decided to try at least to reach through the next four years. 

But now? I may need to devise another backup plan for a career, housing, and future intellectualism. I thought of going to trade school after becoming a mechatronics technician or an electrician, but I don't want to spend more than necessary. Another was that I continued graduate school - my GPA isn't the best (It's 3.7 for those wondering). There aren't enough professors that I am close to for both research purposes and LoRs, as well as my experience being practical so far (IT student job, two tutoring positions, a part-time cashier, and my longest job so far being a security officer) that aren't relevant for graduate schools, so I am not going for that venture. My final thoughts were that I stay with my parents for the rest of my life and work at least 2-3 part-time jobs for roughly 60 hours, and I'd take a few Moodle or Coursera classes to fill that intellectual sense. 

If anything, I think this rat race fuckfest, as well as the surgery and recent attacks on my disposition, made me realize it's not worth putting in the entire effort. Some of my professors were concerned, but I told them I knew what I was doing and that I was all right. I'm unsure if I believe entirely, but I think I'll be OK overall. If anything, the worst-case scenario for my career is that I get a paperweight but still keep my intellectual sense, which I can reignite if I want. My future looks unknown at this point, but maybe I'll be OK or not. 

**TLDR:** Had a recent surgery (and am still recovering) and picked up another minor to at least satisfy my dead-in-the-water intellectual instinct that I had since I first entered college. Not sure what to do career-wise (dream job is to disappear forever and live as a nomad farmer close to a village, realistic job is to consider trade school, grad school, or just part-time jobs), real career prospect in computer science is dead, and my intellectual curiosity about STEM is dwindling but can be revived if possible after Uni. I was just wondering what to do now with an uncertain future, where my disposition may hurt the quality of life I was unfortunately living so far.",DisgruntledCSGrad24

Nowadays it feels like a constant uphill battle  to stave off anxiety. Despite the fact that I'm at the point where I get  to solely take classes that pertain to my major and my interests; it's  getting harder and harder to feel like the end goal is worth it anymore.  That spark of inspiration that I felt my first year of college that  motivated me and gave me a goal to work towards feels so dim now. 

I  talked with my therapist about this and he said it was common for  people to feel this way once getting to grad school with the increase in  difficulty/work load. And I did manage to pass my first semester which  is evidence that I have the ability to succeed.

I’m a freaking junior in college and I still can’t grasp basic algebra and basic long division and mathematics.

I got a 5/20 on the first quiz we took. I was in the library after every class for 3 hours trying to refresh my mind on absolute basic long multiplication and division problems because I completely forgot that I need to add a 0 every time I add something new or that I need to line up the decimals.

If any of you have any questions about my background, please feel free to ask, and I'm happy to go into it, but I won't go into detail at the moment because I don't want to make the post too long.  However, I've been struggling with PTSD nearly my whole life because of childhood trauma.  Ever since my second year of university, things have just gotten worse and worse in my life, and my PTSD is really intensifying.  This past summer was the nail in the coffin for me as I dealt with a summer so horrifying that the experience feels like a movie.

My personal life and mental health struggles are really impacting me, more than I thought it ever would.  I really want to become a creative writer and work in academia, and I can no longer write like I used to.  Any critical or academic essay I write for English courses is terrible nowadays.  I can barely concentrate during the 2 jobs I work, and I make constant mistakes.  When I'm in English, Film, or Creative Writing classes, all I can think about is how I'm not good enough to be there.

I have trouble sleeping and overthink, and when I do sleep, I almost always have just nightmares of me reliving my traumatic memories or imagining traumatic futures that at this point feel inevitable as trauma has always been a part of my life.  My advisors have told me I have no chance for grad school, and that while I have a good shot for a fellowship I want, about half the people from my school get it while the other half don't, which makes me concerned I might not be part of the half that normally does win the fellowship.

I feel so lost, so confused, and I feel like the older I get, the more I'm losing myself.  I used to be the kinda person who would remember everyone's birthday, favorite foods and drinks, and all that kinda stuff.  The person who would reach out to say happy birthday when the day came, or the person to start conversations and ask how people are.  Now, I'm this weird person who feels like I sleep when I'm awake and am awake when I sleep.

I honestly don't know what to do.  I feel like I'm becoming more selfish, more bitter, more cynical, more nihilistic, and more pathetic the older I get, and I don't know how to recover out of this rut.  This is my final year of undergrad, and I want to make the most of it so I don't have regrets on wasting this year, but I just feel so empty.  I feel like I make all my loved ones' lives worse and that the world would be better off without me.

**TL;DR:** I've struggled with PTSD almost my whole life, but it's been especially bad these past few years.  I feel like I'm losing myself, and that I'm becoming a worse person, and I don't know how to juggle my problems while striving for excellence in college and my future.",flightofwonder
607,The amount of people struggling is hard to understand..,0,"I’m in this subreddit because I wanted to understand people and maybe offer advice. I’ve used it a handful of times. But every single semester there is a massive influx of people who are saying college is impossible and they’re completely overwhelmed and failing everything and I just.. don’t get it. 

I’m taking six courses a semester and working full time. I’m a manager at a retail store and I’m there 40-45 hours a week. I’m also taking outside certifications and fulfilling those. I’m prepping for law school. Last semester I took five courses and got three A’s and two B’s; one of these was a five unit research course. I don’t miss assignments and do my readings. I’m even a double major. I am working to live and afford my tuition, not for fun, but I’ve worked up to my spot here (through 2.5 years of other college!) and make pretty good money for my effort. 

I play DND with my friends 2-3 times a month. Before we moved in together, I spent 2-3 nights a week with my boyfriend. Spend the night with my best friend once a week. Managed to diet and make time for recreational activities like painting. Sure, I spent every night doing homework, but it never surpassed 3-4 hours. 

I get homesickness. I get bad study habits. I get mental illness; hell man, I’m stressed and depressed but I’m still not.. failing courses. How are there people here saying they’ve been in college three years and they still spend 10 hours a day studying only to fail a homework assignment? It’s just astonishing to me. Sorry if this makes me sound like a turbo-bitch but I genuinely don’t understand. College isn’t easy but it also isn’t impossible.",Deevys
608,I mentally break down trying to do homework?,94,"I’m not sure what’s wrong with me, I’ve never been as frustrated or as emotionally distressed as I’ve been starting college. I’m at a total loss, I attend class, I take notes, I’m paying attention, then I try to do the homework and I mentally and physically break down. Does anyone know why this happens? I don’t even get an hour into doing it before getting so upset, this is honestly so embarrassing. I feel like a fucking idiot for not understanding simple concepts, it’s literally week 3 and I feel like I’m going to fail terribly. Maybe I’m not smart enough for college.",Lonely_Barista
609,Textbook online courses/access codes make me insane,31,"Like we all know how expensive textbooks are, but at least there is a little positive to them. 1) it's an actual physical item, you don't need a phone, laptop, etc to use it. 2) you can have it and use it for yrs. 3) YOU CAN SELL IT BACK. No you won't get 100% of your money back, but it's \*SOMETHING\*.  


Why do I need to spend $100+ just to log into a website to do homework on, for a class I'm gonna be in person for anyway. OooOOOoOOhhHHh How nice of them, I get \*temporary access\* to their \*ebook\*.   And of course it's not like the textbook is gonna be cheap to make it better, no way man.

They told me to wait till 12/22/23 for the bill to be  finalized. Hence why I'm annoyed at this happening now.

My main issue with this College is absolutely NO ONE knows what the hell is going on. No one knows Graduation fees for cap and gown. No one knows how Courses that go on for TWO semesters work. The system STILL isn't showing the course that I was told I was scheduled for by the head department.

613,Applying to scholarships and to transfer at the same time is a nightmare. Drowning in LoR's and stress.,10,"I feel like I've had to fill out 10 million applications within the last month between fafsa opening late, transfer applications, credit evaluations at said transfer schools, my work, and scholarships, on top of all the beginning of the semester bullshittery. I'm so stressed, and it's not even about school work like assignments or essays, it's about having to fill out all this paperwork and begging professors for LoR's. I get why LoR's are a thing, but they are the absolute worst.

I go to a CC that's like 99% adjuncts, and I feel SO bad asking them to write me LoR's when they're teaching at like 3 different colleges and have a million other things to worry about. I get it's part of their job, but I just hate doing it to them.

I feel like all I do at this point is hover over my email. I hate email. I hate it so much. It's the worst form of communication. 

 I messed up my one app with a very simple, but big,  mistake and I had to call the scholarship people and get it resolved so that my poor profs could even GET their link to submit the damned LoR. Had to send emails like ""Hey, I'm a dipshit and have to fix my app for you to be able to submit, sorry"" to my professors today.

And then transferring is an entire other beast, especially with fafsa deciding to be quirky this year. I've sent in applications, but I can't make a decision because the colleges themselves have absolutely 0 idea how much aid or need based scholarships they can give anyone. Haven't even received the usual tuition estimate paper they send out with your acceptance yet because of everything going on.

614,Anyone have experience transferring from university to community college?,5,"Does anyone have any experience transferring from a big state university to their states cc?

I just started my second semester at University and I’m Cramed into a very uncomfortable forced triple with two roommates that don’t really interact with me. My parents and I pay thousands of dollars for tuition PLUS I have to take out student loans. 

I am strongly considering transferring to my states cc which has a location in my hometown. With my financial aid tuition should be free and my parents and I will save a significant amount of money each semester. On top of that my university and local cc have 2+2 programs and are very interconnected. If I attended cc for 1.5- 2 years, I may be able to knock out a bunch of credits for free and then only have to pay for two years of university after that

Anyone have any experience with this type of situation?

Edit- I also wouldn’t be able to do cc for this semester because it has already closed. I could transfer though, get a full refund on my tuition and do online summer courses at cc. ",UndefeatedToaster
615,Today was the first day of my second semester and I honestly don’t know what to do anymore,18,"
I’ll start off by clarifying that for my first semester this past fall, I relatively did okay emotionally. I passed all my classes which is what I always wanted from that semester with my lowest grade as a B.  Based off what my later sections of this post may imply, I really didn’t feel much  homesickness at all. Unfortunately, I virtually made zero friends. I find myself having a very difficult time to find friends for that semester. Though I was very occupied with studying, I still can’t use that as an excuse for finding no friends.

     Fast forward to this present day of the first day of my spring semester and I have come to a sudden realization: I really really want to go home. I honestly cannot describe how much I wanted to go back and see my family today. I want to see my family again. I want to see my dog again again. I want to see my friends and my hometown again. During my winter break, I had a peaceful life compared to my fall semester. I didn’t see it at the time but it was beautiful. I honestly wish I never took life for granted from that break. I wish that break lasted forever.I regret going to this college I’m in now. It’s two hours away from my hometown. I can’t visit them during the weekends as I have a part time job during the weekends. I hate living here in this college . I hate this city. Now I won’t see my family again until spring break which only lasts a week. I’m also extremely anxious for this upcoming semester. As far as I can see from this course load, it’s going to be harder than my previous semester. Unfortunately, my first semester was very difficult on me as I already spent most of my time studying within the semester. It honestly feels terrible here. I don’t want to even work for this semester. I legitimately cried repeatedly so much throughout the entire day. I looked for any private place to cry whether  it was in a shower or in a private bathroom. I simply don’t want to do this college thing anymore. I’m trying to go for an electrical engineering and based on what I’ve been told, I honestly am not sure if Im even ready for it at this point. I want to be in high school again. I regret going to this place. I wish I had just gone to my local community college just to live with my parents for one more year,  I just want to see my family, my dog, and my friends again. It’s not that they’ll disappear anytime soon but I worry about my family and if my parents or my dog may dies soon. They are very old and I really want to see them again and I worry if they die unexpectedly. I just want to spend the rest of my life with them.

616,So much anxiety,4,"So tmw afternoon is my first class back at college since December and its stressing. I had to switch to part time status because fall semester made me feel so physically bad. I have no idea why, but as i was heading off to uni as a commuter student i started feeling instense anxiety. I was having an easily upset stomach, i would experience low blood pressure, gagging and drops in appetite. Through no fault of my own im currently going thru mild anxiety once again. I thought for so long that i was sick because I was smoking, so i quit smoking but still feel the symptoms. Curiously, over this winter break the symptoms were gone and i regained the weight i lost due to my poor eating habits. But I feel like now that school is about to start the symptoms are coming back, my stomach feels irritable and i gagged again tonight. I dont know what to do, i might have to get medicated atp but I really dont wanna be dependent on some psychiatric drug but if I have to suffer more anxiety like i did this fall semester I would seriously consider just taking the meds. Not only was i mentally and physically terrible from last semester but i also got sick numerous times, and Im trying to keep high hopes but its hard to do so when you feel like you're gonna feel the same terrible nauseating feeling every day until summer",
617,Online college classes are insanely unacademic.,269,"I'm in an online 300-level law class, and I'm astonished by the lack of academic/professional usage on the discussion posts.

I'm even more shocked by the ""citations"" being written as ""This PBS article said..."" with ZERO reference to the author or a link to the website itself.

I'm not saying I'm the most scholarly or gifted writer, but it feels unacceptable to have blatant typos or capitalize random words in the middle of sentences.

618,"Unable to handle being away at college, disappointed by this all",16,"I was supposed to start my 4th semester of college today. But I had to come home bc I had a severe panic attack, one I’ve never had before.

To sum it up, I was debating on either transferring to community college for just the semester or staying at my current university. I decided with my current university. 

I really wanted to go back to college and have this be a fresh semester after the bad one I had before. And so I went in with pure confidence, to the point of maybe I was being unrealistic. I was struck with intense anxiety after eating dinner. It was horrible. I blacked out and an ambulance had to come. Again, I’ve never experienced that before so bad so I was like holy fuck. I can’t stay at my college with this happening. 

So now I’m back home just reevaluating my situation and if I can handle going back. 

My problem is, I really want to be able to go back and be a normal college student, but I’m just not that person right now. My mind wants one thing, yet my body is almost rejecting it (and my mind catastrophizes as a result). 

Also if I take a LOA, I’ll graduate a year late. So my only option is to stick it through, or withdraw and go to community. Right now community might be my best option for my health. 

But I’m still sad of what I’m leaving behind at my college. I’m a great student and I’m social. Last semester tho I barely had a life there so maybe I’m not loosing much after all.

620,cc or 4 year? idk where to go.,3," 

i feel so lost in life right now.

i was always the honors kid in high school and received really good grades and had a few EC's. i was a 2023 senior. i ended up getting rejected from the top schools i applied to - which is honestly fair because im not a student who stands out like the ones who dedicate all their time to academics and are just robots in high school.

but then i was left with a lot of ""just okay"" schools. there were 2 schools that weren't the top in the nation, but they are super super good schools that i could've gone to - but i didn't because of the cost. i ended up going to one of the most awful state schools, the education here is really awful and the programs here aren't that good quality at all. i only went here because i essentially got a full ride. but even the full ride isn't encouraging me to stay at this school.

and now im thinking of transferring - i've applied to 3 uni's that are not the top in the nation but they are really good schools, the quality of education is good there and everything else. it's just not like T20 standards, but the quality is still super good.

but i feel so lost. what if i hate the uni i transfer to? i can't just keep transferring.

and this brings me to my point - i wish i just went to cc instead. it would've been more expensive than the full ride school, but it would've given me more time to choose a school i really like and my cc has better education than the uni i go to.

but it literally does not make sense to go from bad 4 yr uni --> cc --> better 4 year. i just feel so lost and not ready. i love to study and learn, and my GPA at my current schools is a 4.000. so im doing well, but i still feel lost. im an accounting major and i haven't even had any accounting courses yet because of the damn liberal arts requirements. so idk if i like accounting courses.

622,Professors make distance learners feel like the redheaded stepchildren.,11,"A little backstory, I was a senior and chugging right along at my college, and then I had to pick up 3 jobs and school took the backseat. 

Anyway, I had to move away and took a year off. I’m enrolled again as a distance learner at my college in a different major and the difference is day and night. School started again this week and it’s so obvious the professors don’t care as much about the online sections as they do in-person. They’re uploading ancient introduction videos and quiz instructions that aren’t even relevant. For example, one prof was saying distance learners have to come in for test proctoring because no such thing exists online yet. Hello, I’m 500 miles away and online proctoring is very much something that exists. Or giving instructions for D2L navigation when my college moved to Canvas 6 or 7 years ago. Or uploading a syllabus from fall of 2020, and putting all the wrong due dates on Canvas and telling us to refer to the dates on the very outdated syllabus. 

It’s just frustrating and sloppy. I pay the same amount of tuition as I did being in-person and they can’t take the time to upload the correct materials for our success. And of course, they’re impossible to get ahold of unless you show up to their office. 

Don’t get me wrong, I’ve had plenty of in-person professors who refused to utilize Canvas properly, but it wasn’t as big of a deal. When all of your schoolwork hinges on Canvas being set up properly, it’s a little more high-stakes. It just feels like trying to earn my degree online doesn’t matter as much to them.",boooostedvo

Finals hit me like a truck and I clearly didn’t prepare enough for them. I really don’t know how GPAs work so I’m curious if I end this semester with like a 3.4 does it balance my overall GPA to a 2.9?

Also does having a very bad first semester greatly reduce the tier of school your could transfer to.

625,I feel really left out by going to community college,6,"I struggled a lot during lockdown and ended up going to community college. I also struggled when starting out at community college and am spending an extra year or two. It’s so isolating being a community college student, especially a more non traditional one too. 

I was in a carpool ride with a few students who all went to 4 year colleges on track for graduation on time. They were talking about all these niche classes they’re taking, all the campus initiatives they’re apart of, and the cool opportunities their school provides. I felt so withdrawn from the conversation, I kept on thinking I ruined such pivotal time for myself. I know it’s my fault for putting myself in this position, but I resent myself for doing so. 

I’m glad I’m better now and my gpa is good but I hate that I ruined so much for myself to finally get to that point. I feel like I don’t relate to a lot of my old friends or new people I come across. I struggle to explain myself to others what my path is and tbf I’m not sure what my path is either (moreso I’m second guessing myself more than anything).

631,Adding another group project rant to the pile,6,"I know everyone hates group projects, in fact, I know it's so common that it's almost a cliche at this point... But I'm still gonna complain about them. 

**Background** 

So, despite my opener, this term wasn't actually supposed to be that bad. See, I have a capstone class that's rather group project heavy, but a silver lining was presented to us: You can pick your own groups. This does come with a catch though, at the end of the week, you're locked in. 

This is great, because of this being a capstone class, I know who the hard workers are and who the lurkers are. In fact, things were going quite well, I had already gotten in contact with 2 people from past classes who I knew were great workers and decided to form up a group with them. As far as group project go, this was looking like it was going to be a breeze. 

That's until 1 person decided to make this experience hell. I'll call him H for short, you can probably guess why. 

**Experience with H**

I've worked with H before, spoiler. At the start of the year me and him were put in involuntarily groups for another class' project, and it was horrid. Pretty much every reason why can be traced back to H. 

To start with, H is a flake. We had 9 meet ups throughout the class and he showed up to a grand total of 2. It got so bad in fact that one time when I was late to a meet up (Computer issues) the other members were talking about whether H actually existed or not. Keep in mind, these weren't random, Monday or Wednesday were the standard chosen days specifically because we were all free those days, but he could never find the time to make it apparently. 

Next, he never did what he was asked, no, told to do. H has this issue where if we asked him to do something, there was a 75% chance he wouldn't do it. Now we caught on pretty quickly and did extra work in advance just in case he didn't do his part, but honestly, it's just ridiculous that we needed to do this to begin with. 

Which culminated in the experience that made me want to ban him from any future group I was in: The Presentation. 

For the final group project, 3 members minimum needed to present a case study but it could be pre-recorded to meet a time standard (15-20 min), this should've been simple, or so we thought. At the start of the week we told him to read through the case study report in case we need to add more material to the presentation and his answer was ""Ok!"". Well, that was on Monday, and when Friday arrived, when we agreed to record, the first thing we asked him was ""Did you read the case study?""

""oh. sorry. i Forgot."" (He doesn't know how to properly capitalize btw)

We gave him one simple task, to read the already finished report. No writing, no answering questions, *just read.* But no, that was too difficult for him. 

Which made the presentation a hell of a lot harder. We ended up being ~3 minutes short from the minimum limit and so decided to beef up the presentation with material from the case study. What should've been a 30 min deal evolved into 2 1/2 hour test of my patience, as we needed to talk him through the exact parts he needed to present due to a member needing to deal with a family issue and so it was just us 3. We effectively needed to hold his hand like a toddler and guide him through the presentation that he would've already known about had he actually read the report like he said he would do *5 days beforehand.*

**Why is this a problem now?**

This is a problem because H has decided to join my dream group. Not only that, it's an electronic sign up, so he didn't need our permission to put his name down. This group also includes a previous member who's worked with him before and knew exactly what I was talking about when I went over my issues with him joining in, and agreed with me taking action about this. 

But I'm not one to go scorched Earth immediately, so I simply sent him an email saying: ""I'm sorry, you're a nice dude but I don't think our group would be compatible with your work style. Could you please look into other groups, make things less stressful for everyone? I hope this term treats you well and you get an A."" 

Guys, this is his response, word for word: ""I am as well up to the task, But I really find that Unfair with me."" 

You see dear readers, he's under the impression that he's a good group member and will somehow change his previous ways, meaning we can't kick him out because he promises to do a good job this time and the lock in has basically occurred. Likewise, he also thinks it's unfair we're asking him to leave a group he was never invited to to begin with.

So, since we don't have the power to kick people out of the group as they're basically locked in at this point, our best bet is that the professor takes pity on us and moves him out of our group, which from experience isn't normal. (I've asked multiple professors before with other difficult members and all their answers were a resounding ""No. It gives you real world experience!"")

632,sorry for the rant,7," I am a student from a college in India. I’d from a very young age been interested in science. Wanting to read encyclopedias over story books, I fantasized about fast car, radium and robots.

My parents didn’t pressure me into an engineering college, or so I’d like to think.   
 It was either design or engineering for me, as I am quite interested in art as well. 

I chose engineering though, as I felt it would have a greater impact on society than art, and also even if id not blatantly accept it, It was because it’d bring my family a more respect among peers than if id taken arts. But that’s an old story now. It’s been around 15 months since I’ve joined college, and least to say, I’ve been heavily disappointed by the experience. 

There's no one I want to approach for having intellectual discussions, no one to go out exploring with me, very few good friends, and no one who push me to be better.

I feel very alone in my college. My roommate exists, and talks to me when he feels like it. We have a push pull relationship and he gets better grades than me. I’ve devolved to have low self esteem and don’t even want to socialize nowadays. Having been a happy go lucky sort of guy earlier until college began, this feeling of loneliness and stagnation is highly demoralizing.

I do and try learning new things but fail to feel like i'm using and benefiting from any of the knowledge I learn.   
 It’s a bloody mess, that’s what I feel my life has become. 

I am trying to improve now, waking up early for sport/exercise before classes seems like something that can lift spirits. And I hope to improve my grade this semester. 

I swear, I hate this life, I hate it I hate it I hate it. I really wanna fucking live life and grow to be someone better and reliable. 

I might drop an update if life turns out better. But at the moment i'm just a shell of a guy, and have dead eyes.

See you later,

633,High School Friends,6,I go to school A and a bunch of my close high school friends go to college B. I’ve made a few friends in college A but they don’t give me that same happiness and feeling I get when I’m with my high school friends. I recent visited my high school friends a month ago at their college and I had a blast. Now I feel like I made a bad decision by going somewhere else than my highschool friends. Ik if I transfer it wouldn’t be the same because I would have responsibilities of classes and wouldn’t be living with the people I crashed with. So idk if going to that college would be the same as the few days I’ve experienced but now I’m just all stressed about if I made the wrong decision.,mop234
634,I feel so lost,17,"For context, I am a university student in Canada who graduated high school in June last year. I'm probably going to sound really stupid and spoiled for what I'm about to say. I'm well aware that someone of my age should  already know how to navigate these things, but I really need to get this off my chest.

I have no idea how to do anything outside of school. I want to get a summer job so I don't have to rely on my parents as much, but I have no idea where to begin with that. What can I put on my resume? How and where do I apply for a job? What am I even qualified to do in the first place?

I also need to find off-campus housing in preparation for my next year, but I have no idea how to do that either. I know where to look for rooms, but I have no idea how to find roommates and sign a lease. 

It feels like I'm lagging so far behind compared to everyone else. All of my friends from high school have everything figured out while I'm still trying to catch up. They have good social lives, internships, grades, etc. My grades are good, but that's all I have going for me. I feel like such a worthless piece of shit right now.

I have a concentration of marine and coastal ecology and attend an expensive OOS school, so I thought, why not pursue what I like and I'm passionate about? I'm in two research labs for envisci, work under a professor for astro in theoretical astrophysics , am an outreach intern for my college's honors program, am an RA for an international residential college to help cover tuition costs, and help run a lit magazine, am an officer for a derby club, and do graphic design for an arts magazine. I've also written a graphic novel over the course of the past two years.

I've prided myself on taking an interdisciplinary approach. I did research in computational evolutionary biology on birdsong when I was in high school, and am really into field work for envisci. I'm hoping to link astronomy and environmental science by my background in tidal forces and how they may effect the ecology of certain coastal/estuary habitats. When I'm out, I hope to work for the EPA/fish and wildlife/ USACE and use my background in art history to better support solutions that are beneficial for the environment and for surrounding communities, taking their histories and cultures into account.

But I feel like I'm failing at everything. My GPA is fine (3.22, got it up from a 3.17 last semester to a 3.359 this one taking 17 credits), I have a lot of lab experience, I have a job, good recs...I know my stuff and how to apply it. I'm great at interviewing. I'm good at connecting the dots. If you teach me something, I can learn it quickly. I ask for feedback. I practice. I can do anything I can put my mind to, even if I'm not good at it. I will work to make it better. Yet, I'm starting to look for jobs and I feel useless. Internships and jobs have turned me down because it's either ""extremely competitive"" or it's because of a business decision. I feel like with jobs that are looking for people to complete specific tasks, I look useless. I don't feel practical. And it kills me every time. I want to get my PhD in the future, but how can I do anything if I can't even get an interview?? They don't even know me. I don't know what more I can do. Do I need to solve climate change? I'm working on getting my GPA higher and plan on writing two theses. 

Nobody told me that envisci jobs outside of consulting don't really pay anything above 60k until after I was knee deep in. I go to a T25 school. I just don't know what to do at this point.

638,rant,2,"So recently i’ve been thinking into more life and thinking how i could make money and college work. I live in NYC and looking for colleges upstate but knowing i’m from a low income family paying from dorms and things are in issue for me.

I know i’ll have to apply for scholarships and FASFA and things like that. But i don’t want to be applying for loans and end up in years and years of debt or just ended having to drops I hate it because i’ve always dreamed about going to college for the longest time and wanted to graduate with no debt like my sister who graduated from NYU from the many scholarships she applied to. I don’t have a problem with scholarships but it’s been hard to find the perfect scholarships because i’m not a good writer nor am i the person to remember to apply and would forget that i even applied to do them.

I just want to be able to get a full ride or just enough money to pay for everything and not being able to worry about anything like my sister who was able to dorm all her 4 years. I just wish money wasn’t a problem in the world and that i’m able to have a fun college life freely. If anyone has any advice you can share them. I just needed to let my concerns loose. 

Thank you if you read everything ^^ Tl;DR (?)",Imaginary_Reveal_358
639,Double dorms shouldn’t exist,437,"The title may be exaggerating.

I absolute hate college dorms. Or more specifically MY college dorms. I don’t like the fact that I’m literally living in a box, our beds are couple feet apart, my bed is smaller than a twin, there’s not much space for storage, and whenever something is broken it takes months to fix. I also dislike having a roomate. I hate the fact that after work I can’t come to the dorm and relax by myself, I can’t get even an hour of free time to enjoy the room by myself after school and work. My call time to my significant other is limited, we talk hours on end everyday but I can’t do that because 1. That’s obnoxious unless it’s a whisper but he’s old and can’t even hear me
There’s not even a common area, it’s straight up just two beds in a room smaller than a studio, how do colleges expect people to feel about this?

The singles are all taken up by RA’s, even some RA have a roommate because of the overcapacity. I hate how after work I circle the parking lot for half an hour trying to get a parking space.

To make it worse, dorms is required the first two years of uni, I’m going on my third year and can’t even get an on campus apartment because housing is incompetent, they never want to work or do anything. I don’t have enough income to trust that I can pay for off campus housing all bymyself including other fees like groceries and etc. so I’m fine in a shared on campus apartment where I at least get my own bedroom and bathroom but I can’t even get that!! 

It sucks how they lure you into thinking you can tolerate living on campus until you realize these people actually don’t wanna work. I can confidently say that the ONLY aspect of this school that I have enjoyed since enrolling was the fact that it’s majority women. Even the classes are a disappointment.

TL;DR: Double dorms shouldn’t exist because expecting Two people to live a couple feet away from eachother in one room is ridiculous. Including other ridiculous housing issues. I’ve had to come across this school year. ",Jenphanies
640,Barely passed my 3 week Gen Chem course.,42,"I had no choice but to take it since I switched majors late or else I would not graduate on time. It was a prereq for many of my courses for the major I switched to. I was in Chem for a couple of weeks during the fall semester. I promptly dropped it because I got sick for 2 weeks and had a conference for my organization. Other than that, all materials in Gen Chem are new to me. I took up a 3-week Gen chem course and took my final today... I barely scraped by with a 68% in the class. fuuck. I'm so disappointed with myself. I really worked hard to claw myself out of academic probation during my freshman year from a 1.6-> 3.0 now my GPA is going back to a 2.85 I'm honestly really upset right now. I felt like I understood most of the material, but maybe I didn't.. then again the course was insanely fast-paced. We went through 5 chapters in 5 days. and I needed more practice. It was one of the hardest thing I've ever done. on the bright side, I didn't fail... and it still counted.

641,My residence life office locked me out of a room with most of my belongings in it. Is there anything I can do?,3,"
This is such a weird post to be making, but here goes. I’m sure I’m partially in the wrong for this but I’m just really upset that this is the route they took. I’ll give a play by play of the situation. I live in a college house. The house next to mine happens to house 4 of my best friends- it is a volunteer house that I had previously lived in, but due to some technical issues I got placed in the one next door instead. One of my friends, who we’ll call Charlie, had decided either before or during winter break that he was going to drop out. All of us are torn up about it. But the other friends suggested I moved in as that’s what I wanted to do anyways.

One friend, who we will call Jermaine, sends residence life an email asking if I can move in. They say sure, I just have to fill out the form January 22nd to move in. I’ll admit, I do think after reading the email what he told me was a little misconstrued, but I don’t blame him necessarily. He just thought by them saying okay it meant okay. 

He moves a couple boxes in the room of stuff we both share- some sentimental things, books, not much. This is where things get messy. After winter break, we all go to bed. I go to bed in my room (not the new one) and quickly become uncomfortable. It’s cold. Very cold. We live in an area where it’s common to go below zero in winter, and I’m confused- it’s never been this cold in my room.

Turns out, maintenance “forgot” to turn my house’s heat on after break. I have stuff that cannot be exposed to such cold temps and was instantly worried, but that’s not all. After just a little while, I had gotten sick. I’m not sure if it was due to the cold or something else, but either way it wasn’t safe for me as a sick person to just deal with how cold it was. The RA had tried and failed to call maintenance, leaving SEVEN messages with no answer. I asked Jermaine what to do and he said to just come over- I’m moving there soon anyways, so he didn’t see an issue since it was empty. 

I only just got notified that the heat was turned back on yesterday evening. This morning, Jermaine received an email saying they checked to see if the room was vacant (?) and saw boxes in there. They said if the stuff wasn’t removed by next week, they would trash it all. This wasn’t just the boxes he put in there- since the heat stopped, I had brought the stuff sensitive to the cold, my clothes, and my blankets. It’s whatever, I’ll just move the stuff back.

Nope. They LOCKED THE DOOR. I’m confused. If they wanted us to move the stuff, why are they locking the door? He sent an email in response to theirs saying the situation. He also didn’t feel like the stuff should be moved considering a.) I am moving in in less than a week, and b.) I am sick as is but also have a hand injury that would make it take significantly longer if I have to move it all myself, and they only give you a couple days to move. I also have severe (as in, pretty pretty bad) OCD, so the fact that my stuff is not in access to me makes me panic bc idk if they touched it or anything and I have no way to check. 

Again, I’m sure some of this is my fault. I’m just upset because either way they saw that my bedding and clothes and toiletries were in there, and now I don’t have access to ANY. I have to borrow all of Jermaine’s stuff until they decide to unlock the room god knows when. Is there anything I can do for the time being that will ease my stress?",lawfullytired
642,Being a sophomore in college feels harder than freshman year,11,"I had a rough semester with my mental health but I ended up getting the help I needed with therapy and talking with my doctor. I feel stronger and motivated to go back, yet I have a sense of fear and worry. 

I’ve been home for longer than winter break bc of my mental health, and now I have to go back Monday and I’m just worried about it. Getting back into the routine, the responsibilities, being away from home, my family, and pets. 

I’m a sophomore and I thought it would get easier but if anything leaving home is harder as a sophomore than as a freshman. It felt so much more exciting as a freshman but at the same time I was literally overworking myself then. It just feels very intimidating right now going back, considering my situation and just getting back into the routine. 

I am telling myself I can do it but I wish I could jump to a month into the semester to see how I’m managing and doing. Especially since last semester was ROUGH. I want to be happy at school truly and I worry what if I’m not?

644,I’m feeling so overwhelmed this semester.,20,"Usually I feel pretty confident in my ability, and I accomplished perfect grades my first year of college. However, my new job takes up a considerable amount of my cognition during the week, lol. Although I love my job and It's giving me a considerable competitive edge for my degree, I am mentally exhausted after work. My classes are full time as well. With 2 in person and 2 online. Meeting 3 times a week, and on top of that I'm volunteering. 

Last semester I took more classes, but I was always stressed over money, and I was working part time. Still, totally secure and confident in my ability to maintain my grades.

Maybe I'm underestimating myself here, or going through something, but I'm so afraid this is the semester I mess up my GPA and any chances of getting into my dream schools. I'm also terrified I'll tank this semester and ruin chances for grad school, as the programs for my degree (clinical psych) are extremely competitive. 

I can't quit my job, and I'm as organized as I possibly can be. But I still feel like I’m going to have a panic attack at any moment. I'm working with patients that have extreme mental disorders and are obviously very emotional sometimes. And I love being there for them, but I didn't consider how taxing this would be during school. 

I know I'll have to juggle these responsibilities and even more in grad school but I'm worried I'm going to burn myself out before I even get there. It could also just be all these major changes happening at once too. New extremely important job, applications for transfer, and start of a new semester. I'm also working out the details of moving when I transfer too. UGH

I know it'll be okay, but I can't convince my subconscious to take a breather. I don't want to mess everything up. I think if I receive a singular B I will have a melt down.

In the syllabus, the professor noted how online students are “far more brave” than in-person students when it comes to questioning grades and individual marks on assignments. 

In response, he established a “challenge” system where you may challenge a grade by emailing him a 1 page, evidence-based essay proving why your grade should be corrected. 

The fun part is if you’re challenge is unsuccessful. If he finds your evidence insufficient, he DOUBLES the amount of points taken off that assignment. 

I for one find this hilarious, and ultimately harmless as you aren’t required to challenge. However, I can see how some might argue this is rather brazen. Any thoughts?",Jaqelun

648,PackBack/AI Teaching Rant,13,"One of my courses this semester requires us to use a platform called PackBack, which is a discussion board forum. PackBack uses AI to grade discussion board posts with a ""creativity score"" automatically. For my course, my professor requires us to have a score of 80 or higher to get full credit. From what I have observed so far, PackBack bases this score on post length, varied sentence structure, citing sources, and using ""big"" vocab words... In other words, I have figured out the algorithm and now I don't have to be ""really"" creative (I have only done 1 assignment on PackBack and I cracked it already). My professor requires us to make a 500-word (minimum) post *every week*, post an ""original question"", and write a 200-word response to another student's ""original question"".

My main complaint is that I don't see how this platform is useful. This is a 4000-level course, being graded on whether one can successfully write up to par with the average high school student. No one is even going to *read* my posts, as my grade is based solely on meeting word count and whether the AI determines I did ""good enough"". The professor doesn't do anything. He has recycled lecture videos from 2016 and auto-graded quizzes on Canvas. Yet he can't even take the time to read his student's hard work, which he requires weekly. I am a very fast writer (seriously, I typically can write a 10 page essay in \~1 hour), but it took me almost an hour and a half just to finish my initial post due to the amount of research and leading questions he asks. Very frustrating that in a world where professors complain about students getting ""lazy"" and using ChatGPT they are too lazy to actually do the job they get paid for. I would also like to say that I go to a top 20 public university and my program specifically is one of the foremost in the country, so I really don't see any excuses for this shoddy excuse of a professor.

657,Regretting my choice,2,"I'm currently studying international secondary school teacher's education with a specialisation in English (extremely specific, I know) in the Netherlands. Since day one in September I've hated it. I studied Creative Media and business for two years at another university and I left due to issues with credits from my first year and restrictions on creativity. I'm 22 now and I've accomplished nothing but a high-school diploma. My workload in my old university was much higher than this one and although the pressure is a lot lower I had to move to a small town in the middle of nowhere , where job opportunities that fit with my study are basically nonexistent (either late night shifts or almost full-time work), to study here and I feel I'm getting nothing out of it. I have ten hours of classes each week with at most five hours of self study and project work per week.

The communication between teachers and students is terrible, making everything more stressful. The information is conveyed to us as if we're small children and I'm just not happy with the education I'm getting. If I drop out now I'll probably never get into another school but I don't think I can keep this up for another 6 months until I get the credits needed to transfer somewhere else. 

I've asked to accelerate the program for myself and others countless times but my teachers keep saying no, giving me more anxiety because I was told when I did a tour that we would be finished by the end of May at the latest, now I hear that it might go until mid-July based on retakes which HAVE TO be in person. This also means I won't be able to visit my family back home in Canada this summer.

661,Failed an exam I thought I did well in.,358,"
Just a little rant to get this off my chest. I've just completed my final exam for the first semester in my Intro to Law subject. (I'm a first-year college student, and my chosen course is legal management.) I really thought I aced it—not to brag, but every topic I memorized and studied appeared in the exam. 

For context, my final exam was purely situational analysis and essay-type, similar to a bar exam. I used the ALAC (Answer, Legal Basis, Analysis, and Conclusion) method, as taught by our professor. I genuinely believed that I did well and felt confident about getting a good score.

However, a few days ago, my world crumbled. I received my final exam grade via class beadle during our semester break, and I was told I scored 60/100, with the passing grade being 75. Some classmates even scored 113/100. My two friends, whom I usually outscore, got 65 and 73.

This was the only exam I thought I aced, and now I'm questioning if my best wasn't good enough. 
Which hurts a lot considering how proud I was of myself for answering the questions ""correctly"" and how I proudly told my family and friends how i answered the exam and how proud I am of myself for doing so etc. 


Last midterms, I thought I flunked my exam which in all honesty I thought I really did since I didn't have enough time to answer all the questions but guess what, I scored high during the midterms so why and how did my finals turn out like this? 

Should I stop expecting to avoid disappointment? I'm so hurt I want to cry, but I have no one to talk to about it because I feel ashamed of even believing in myself. I'm even hesitant to expect anything. I'm an average student and not really someone you can call smart. I thought that pursuing a law degree that I had passion for was the best option but now I'm questioning whether or not this is the right degree for me.

Has anyone had a similar experience? Does it get better? This one low score feels like it might bring down my overall grade for the first semester, especially since I missed a few quizzes. I feel like a failure, as if I'm not allowed to take pride in my skills because what if I face disappointment again?

That's all, just needed to get this off my chest. Thank you for reading 🤍",AchillesHeel_9

669,What is the point in scheduled tests for online classes?,5,"In addition to the absurd amount of work certain classes have, adding a scheduled test for a specific day never fails to throw off my week. I can see that having scheduled tests in person when you may have multiple classes or too many students, is appropriate even at inconvenient times. But that's not an issue for online classes in the same way. 

If these tests aren't proctored there's no reason I should have to block out a weekend day to do a test for a class that I've finished the weekly work for days earlier. It would be one thing if it was on a weekday **I guess**, where I can expect the possibility of doing extra work, but interrupting my weekends to do a test that I could do literally any day seems intentionally malicious.

Not to mention people that have jobs, or weird schedules, and if your work days coincide with these tests days, weekend or not, I guess you're just screwed to have to either take the test in uncomfortable inappropriate circumstances like during work or being dead tired afterwards. It almost defeats the purpose of taking an online class in the first place since a lot of people I know do it because their jobs are too demanding to allow them consistent in person class scheduling.

I've got a wedding to go to and it lines up with the exact time frame of a midterm I have coming up, and if the professor doesn't let me change the time (and I am getting the feeling its not going to happen) then I'm screwed to have to take the midterm on my phone on the plane or something in really uncomfortable circumstances which will surely affect my concentration, focus, and score.

Hello, I am a sophomore scholarship student at an expensive university with a good academic record and huge social scene. But, I struggle in day to day life. The people at this school all have more than me considering that they all go on lavish vacations and ski trips at least 2x a year and it's not that I am envious but, more sad at their lack of understanding others positions. I am struggling because due to my financial situation I am unable to join these fraternities which all my friends from freshman year have now joined. I was extended a bid by these fraternities (before someone says no bid) but, was unable to accept due to the dues reaching upwards of 1.2k a year. But, what really bugs me is how these kids don't understand the privilege that money brings them. I worked 40+ hours in the summer and part time during the school year and it just feels like it is impossible to keep up with kids getting thousands of dollars from their parents each year, and it takes a toll on my self esteem because no matter how hard I work I can't seem to compete on their level of money and have to pick and choose which events I can attend. It feels like around campus no one understands. When I return home though I am beginning to fall out of sorts of close friends who kinda just ran the course in my hometown.

674,Scared to look at my grades from last semester,30,"Note: This is a clear first world problem post, this is just to vent, overall probably not a big deal compared to what other people face.

But yeah pretty much the title. I think I bombed one of my finals for a class I was sitting at a 93% in. This final makes up 30% of my grade, and when I took the final, I felt like I got nothing right. The final was incredibly difficult, and IDK if the professor was willing to curve it.

There was also another class where no matter what I did, I never could catch a break in it. The tas did grade rather harsh, but I also made dumb mistakes that were punished more than other math classes.   I felt I did well on the final, but idk if it is enough for me to get a good score (for my standards, again first world problem). 

I was calculating my gpa last month and in a worst case scenario, I would lose something like .11 for my gpa (So like going from a 2.22 to a 2.11 for example), and I am pretty sad because I spent the first 2 years trying to make my gpa above a certain cutoff for a university reward, which after this semester I am not sure I will be able to get anymore by the end of senior year. So I have been dooming a lot on checking my grades because I don't want to see how bad I did.

As of last school year you now get charged fees at $30 per day to change your schedule and then only have until that Saturday. It does not matter which day your class starts meeting either (so if you have a TU/TH CLASS, you'll get charged $60 for swaping after the first class). You're not allowed overrides from professors or departments anymore either. This was only changed at my particular campus but all the other universities in our University system which are all public schools have not changed this policy.

Our Student Government president brought it up to administration and they alluded to that they are doing this to fill budget holes by holding students accountable for changing classes they didn't want to take.

691,COA as a returning adult learner has me feeling defeated,4,"TL;Dr: college expensive, me poor (despite good effort). 

questions: is COA for four years as low as 178k USD and as high as 230k USD for two people as high as I feel like it is? Is this stickershock? 
What would we do if we needed to bail on the plan?

Part vent, part seeking advice. 
I apologize if this is all over the place. 
I just spent the whole evening pouring over and finalizing a spreadsheet to get some facts. 

So I ran the numbers for my husband and I (early 30's) to return to school as full timers, full focus as engineering students, but it seems impossible from where we're standing. Haven't felt this down in a while tbh. 

We're currently CC students going part-time, making little wins every semester. Both got full A's last semester and was flying high, hence why we looked into this. We're good students, he has 4.0 as a freshmen, and I have 3.75 as a sophmore but at this pace, it'll take over 8 years, and will cost way more staying part-time throughout than if we went full time upfront.  

The COA for four years is looking to be as low as 178k after max Pell, and as high as 230k in a worst case scenario for the both of us. This is because we'd need to pay our regular living expenses (already shoe string/very frugal) in addition to tuition. Is this a bad amount? It seems not horrible in the scheme of student loans but it feels horribly high for us. 

I don't think we can realistically get loans for this amount, or atleast the amount needed per semester even though our projected household income would be at a minimum 140k once securing jobs in our field for the first year. 

Which brings me to the next point, we're both going for electrical and computer engineering - the odds of failure are so high, that it's scary to commit to loan sizes for such a ""scary"" degree path. I have confidence in my choice, but I don't know how the engineering classes will go just yet as we've only done gen eds so far. 

This wouldn't be such a hard decision if medical or the schooling wasn't so fucking expensive and if we didn't have regular adult bills. I just don't know what to do, but the way we're going right now, we're currently guaranteed no retirement unless we do this...
(The degree pathway is insanely fun for us so far and it's something we've both have had a passion for naturally, so it's not all about the money, more 50/50). 

Thankfully we have some major pluses going for us: got a house with a low mortgage and low interest rate, own two cars out right, got a university we like in town, currently employed with a CC and get tuition steeply discounted for both of us, and have half decent credit scores. 

Despite this, it feels like trying to turn lead into gold...

Though these numbers are as worst case scenarios, meaning no scholarships outside of Pell, minimal Pell or that we don't get any internships or income during the 4 years. Am I overreacting/having sticker shock?",Strange_plastic

I have never felt ""old"" before in my life; for 3 years I worked in a place where I talked to many older folks and it gave me a new outlook on what it means to be ""old"" (the answer is, you're never old until you decide you are). However, after spending a year in classes surrounded by 18-22yos it seems like they're *obsessed* with aging, and it's wearing on me. Every day I hear, ""I don't want to turn 20, I'll be so old,"" or ""You're 21? Damn, you're old."" It sounds absolutely ridiculous, but every time it makes me just a little more self-conscious. I'm still in the prime of my youth, but I feel like a grandmother.

My depression gets so bad when the school semester is in session that I hardly have to motivation to get out of bed to go, but I force myself most days.

I don't care if I land some job making a bunch of money, I just want to be happy at this point, embrace my relationship, and work some modest job. I've honestly had some less than happy thoughts while I'm in school and just want to put it behind me. I took a semester off and came back this past fall, and even though I was just bartending, traveling a little, and hanging out with friends it felt like the best time of my life so far. My negative thoughts went away, I was less depressed, and I was able to focus on my relationship more which made me happy. But it's came back in full swing since I'm back. I just have this unbearable weight to not make my mom disappointed, I don't know what to do. Just coming to vent and maybe get advice of from someone else that feels like they've been in this dark pit.

718,Abuse by undergrad research supervisors,4,"I am an undergrad. I had a traumatic experience during summer research that took me a while to recognize. For context I had multiple PIs for this project and I go to a small college that only has undergrads. I heard lots of horror stories about graduate students getting abused by their PIs but I had no idea I’d face similar abuse as an undergrad. 

\- I was given an **exploding offer with an unusually early deadline** that prevented me from applying for other opporutnities that would have been a better fit. In fact, the deadline came earlier than the application deadline for the college-wide summer research funding application, which prevented me from even applying for it. I asked if the deadline could be extended but was told no without a reasonable explanation. I committed because the summer internship market was in bad shape, but I regret this decision looking back. Despite being asked to commit unusually early, the PIs provided almost no information about this project until the first day. Neither did any of my labmates. 

\- PIs reneged on follow-up opportunities that wee advertised as part of the program when they were soliciting applications. They said they are planning to hire all summer interns as RAs for the following semester but changed that to hiring 1-2 students. I expressed interest afterwards but recieved a response 

\- I reached out to other people (other professors, more experienced students) for guidance about this situation, but it wasn’t helpful. Some of them said they didn’t have capacity to talk. Some misled me to believe this situation was acceptable. For instance, I found myself putting in extra unpaid hours to read dei related papers and write a proposal out of it. I talked abt this to another professor but he told me I was “in good hands” and led me to believe this is not a red flag. 

\- I got weird hostile vibes from labmates - this was a lab group of 5 students and 3 of them already knew each other. They seemed to cluster among themselves and not want to interact with me. I brought this up to one of the PIs but she dismissed it. I took her advice to heart, but I think she gaslit me about this. 

\- I constantly felt like a burden. The majority of my labmates and the PIs were \*nice\* on the surface but I don’t think they ever showed kindness towards my situation. I thought I felt this way because I was dealing with health issues that interfered with my ability to do labwork, but I now believe the hostile environment was making my health issues worse. 

\- I was advocating for something (won't go into detail to avoid doxxing myself). Professor said she needs to ""push back"" on my idea and explained her point of view. I thought her point of view actually has a lot in common with mine and asked for a meeting to talk more about it. She refused saying that ""she told me she didn't want to talk about it"". It felt passive aggressive and I was drained to the point I thought it’d be pointless to push the issue further. I tried to use other avenues to do it myself but I didn’t have the energy left to pull it off. 

\- The same professor appropriated my idea without giving me credit and froze me out of follow-up opportunities it generated. This is not the first time I was treated this way in college. I submitted a grant proposal to college administration only for them to deny the proposal BUT take my idea without attributing credit. I see a pattern where **authority figures made deliberate choices to take my idea but deny me the space to participate in relevant opportunities.** 

\- I believe I was being covertly excluded because I spoke up about disability inclusion. I talked to the professor because I noticed that the rest of the lab responded with a hostile silence whenever I talked about disability inclusion. However, the professor said the other labmates were silent because they were ""processing"" and implied that I was taking up too much space (I don't believe this is true). Looking back, their silence was in fact hostile and I'm disturbed that the professor was downplaying the hostile environment I was dealing with. 

\- I suspect this professor was being dishonest to me when I asked about follow-up opportunity that was advertised as part of the research project. They claimed the application deadline passed but I have no clear memory of hearing about a solid deadline. It could've slipped from my memory but this situation feels very suspicious. 

\- I didn’t know I was being mistreated until well after the end of the project. I only found out because one of my PIs randomly blew up at me and launched personal attacks after I made a mistake that didn’t warrant that level of aggression. I remember feeling extremely drained during the research period but I attributed it to my health issues. Looking back, i can tell that the hostile environment was taking a toll. 

I had a very hard semester due to burnout and health issues. I’m going to take a leave. I don’t think I’d ever want to come back to this school. I don’t want this experience to knock me out of pursuing higher education, but I’m sincerely afraid it might happen. As a multimarginalized person, I had to fight people who told me that \[my college\] will be “too tough for me because it’s prestigious” and it’d ""take me 8 years to graduate"". I don’t want to vindicate them but I can’t go on taking this kind of abuse forever. ",throwaway_6348
719,Had a bad semester because of severe depression,51,"I’m a junior in animation school right now. I’ve gotten straight A’s for many semesters. I was an honors and AP student in high school. But this semester, I fell into a deep depression after being off antidepressants for a year.  I started self harming after four years of being clean. Now I’m back on antidepressants, and feeling better
now that break has started, but the damage has already been done. I didn’t pass in all my work this semester because I rotted in bed some days.  I should also mention I have ADHD that I’ve attempted to medicate, but it went poorly.  

I know I passed my classes, but the grades won’t be too hot, I know that. And my parents are VERY involved with what I get in my classes. They’ve told me “B’s are below you” when I got a B in class in middle school, and that saying has haunted me for years. They keep asking me when I’ll get my grades, even though I’ve already told them the date they’re due.

I’ve been trying to reason with myself over this.  For one, I’ve been telling myself that I passed my classes because professors are required to email you if you’re failing, so I won’t be retaking anything, and all the credits will go towards my degree. Secondly, this is the final stretch. I don’t plan on getting a masters, so my BFA will be the final degree, and the degree is what matters. Thirdly, portfolio is more important than grades. No employer in the animation industry is going to ask me for my transcript, they’re going to ask me for my art. This semester, I had to make an animated film in a month and show it to the juniors in my major, and a professor said it was one of the best in the showing.  At the very least, that’s something that has made me feel better.

I just feel like I’ll be viewed as a lazy person once my grades come out.  I went from working on art till 7 a.m. to fighting with myself to pick up a pencil.  I had a professor last semester who was one of the hardest and most honest I’ve ever had, but they gave me an A and since then they’ve become sort of a mentor to me.  They keep telling me I have a fantastic work ethic and I’m “a gem,” but I don’t feel that way at all.

I took a course this semester that I ended up dropping. Besides having no background in the topic, and my school messing up the pre-requisites (my counselor told me she suggests waiting until students have more calculus classes than what the university requires, guess I learned the hard way), the professor was just not good. It seemed like it was his first class teaching, as he had no reviews prior to this.

I thought my struggle might have been unique to me, as people didn't really seem to be struggling. But after checking his reviews after this semester, he has a 1.1/5, with a lot of reviews considering it was his first class there. It is by far the lowest score I've seen on there. So...

BUt I've got procrastination at its peak. Ive got an arrear to and Ive got to pass that so that I can sit for placements in next semester. 

FK it man all this hard work just to waste it all before the finals. If i was still going to college I wouldve studied something. But this study leave made me procrastinate a lot and now I dont think I can study enough to pass the exam.",shadobrado
723,My mom said my good grades were because of grade inflation,2778,"I got a 4.0.  5 classes, 15 credits, highest grade a 100% and the lowest a 92.46%.  I’m a first semester freshman.  I was so excited to show my mom my grades, especially because I was worried about being away from home for the first time.  I showed her, and she kind of laughed and said “well I don’t know how much of that is because of hard work and how much is grade inflation, but good job I guess”

Meanwhile my brother is in year 5 of a 4 year degree, failed the same class twice, and needs my mom to write his papers for him.  I worked damn hard for my grades, barely skipped class, studied, turned in assignments days ahead of time, and did it by myself.  How is my brother’s 80% “good” and not “grade inflation” while my grades are just because “a 100 doesn’t mean what it used to”

Are my grades worth less just because school comes easier to me?  Should I do what my brother did and go cold turkey on all my meds, spiral into a deep depression, and fail a bunch of classes so when I get a 70 I get a party thrown for me?

Right now I have 31 credits and I haven’t even started the spring semester.  I’m just pissed that she won’t appreciate how hard I’m trying.

TL;DR: mom said my (first semester freshman) 4.0 wasn’t because I worked hard",Girly_Attitude

I constantly keep getting reminded about my age and where I stand in life, I feel so bad like for how long am I gonna spend time overthinking trying to execute a plan. I don't know what to do. I feel like maybe I should just go to my college website, and see what programs they offer and how long does it take to finish but also see the potential opportunities for growth and salary. I'm just lost and stuck in this rut for over a year or two. I wanted to sign up for classes since new semester new year will begin.. I feel discouraged to reach out to advisor because I never feel like I get any right guideline. I Google and YouTube videos but it's okay. I'm not sure exactly how to get help or whom to reach out for better accurate assistance.",Akashh23_pop
725,Was it acceptable that my professor only chose to curve some students?,34," 

While  this happened a few semesters ago, I am still confused behind the  logic. Basically, the prof mentioned that the average grade for her  class is required to be B. If it is lower or higher, she will need to  curve up or curve down.

&#x200B;

After the  final exam, she confirmed there was a curve applied to increase the  average grade to B. I was so happy that my B+ would become A-. But I  checked and there was no curve for me. I asked my prof and she said  something like she tried to curve my grade and other B+ students to A-,  but it messed with the average grade. I just accepted it and took the  B+.

&#x200B;

But I later knew a student  that got his B- curve to B. So is this acceptable? I have no idea how it  is fair that only some students are getting curve. I have never heard  of this kind of curve.",Terrible_Exchange653
726,Failed to hit a 2.0 on my academic probation semester,62,"Last semester (Semester 2) I bombed most of my classes awfully, resulting in D's and F's across the board. It landed me with a 1.4 gpa

Over the summer I got a letter saying I was on academic probation, so I lowered the amount of classes I had down to three, retook two classes, and got passing grades. This got me up to a 1.88, and I needed a gpa of 2 to keep going, to my knowledge.

Is there anything I can do to keep going? I really truly do want to keep going to college to further my education and eventually get a job in the field I'm going for.

727,bruh moment,7,"prolly gonna delete this later but here goessss

before i start i 100% know this is my own stupidity, ive been beating myself up over it for the past few days i just need to tell people who understand and probably won’t make fun of me haha 

i’m a sophomore in my first semester. it’s been a really tough semester for me, my mental health has been in the shitter (found out i most likely have ocd), extracurriculars have been growing in responsibility and a lot of things in my personal life have happened. to total all of this, my motivation has been really really low, and it’s been a herculean task to force myself to go to class even once a week and turn in assignments 

somehow, despite all of this, i’ve managed to do a decent enough job in all of my classes, and have gotten all As. 

except one, and for a very very stupid reason. i feel even worse than i would’ve if i genuinely slacked off and did shitty in this class.

this class, despite it not being anything for my major, I’ve poured probably the most time and energy into. I’ve spent hours doing homework, reading and rereading the textbook and taking copious notes. i can’t stress enough how many things I’ve been late to due to studying for this specific class. 

finals week was rough, especially with one class not confirming we had a final until like a few days before it was due, packing my dorm and having to get my classes for spring in order. we had an oral exam for the class above i’ve mentioned, and since i am HORRIBLE at oral exams generally i worked my ass off studying for this exam, shedding many tears (and my hairline)  and having to gain a quizlet plus trial for it. this exam was very hyped up, we got like 4 huge sheets with practice questions we might get, i made up answers for each of them and memorized them ALL. 


that day, friday, i showed up to the oral exam and actually did pretty well! it was much easier than i expected, and didn’t pull from any of the more complex questions so i passed. my prof high fived me afterwards and said “see you next friday!” i stupidly didn’t think too much of it because i had an exam DIRECTLY after this one and needed to run, plus had another major exam 2 days later and needed to study for that one. i genuinely thought the see you next friday thing was a send off party as my prof has always talked about having one, and my goldfish brain didn’t remember her saying anything about anything on friday (and brightspace didn’t, either, i spent a long time studying on there)

because of a family event (and me getting COVID a few days later) i had to move home on tuesday, right after what i thought was my last in person final (i had an online essay due friday, but didn’t stress much about it) the first couple weeks of vacation were alright ig

but then i finally took up the courage to check my grades. a big fat incomplete for this class i worked hard on. turns out the “see you next friday” was for an exam i never knew existed. i’ve always been afraid of my school email for a situation exactly like this one, and it was my prof rightfully scolding me about missing this exam and going mia. 

i’ve been actively panicking over the past few days because even though my gpa is probably okay if i fail this course i might only get 11 creds for this semester and have to give up my scholarship that keeps me at school (my parents are too poor to pay but too “rich” to get a pell grant) that requires 30 creds per year :/  sometimes life gives you Ls

i emailed my advisor to ask what i should do next and i still don’t know if my prof will let it slide or not 

TL;DR: thought i passed my classes, turns out i passed my gasses (missed exam i didn’t know existed)

ps mods this isn’t plagiarism i originally made a throwaway to post this but it didn’t work so im taking the plunge on main lol

728,"School is all busywork, i hated it, and I'm dreading going back",14,"My second trimester starts in less than a week now and I'm so stressed about it I can't even enjoy the last of my winter break. I really had a tough time first semester, even though on the surface everything went right for me. I made a few friends (acquaintances.... we just get lunch together sometimes), I got straight As (at fucking Northwestern University no less), I've joined a few clubs with some great people, and I took a bunch of classes I was really interested and still... it just sucked.

I feel like I spend all of my time every day on busywork. I know Northwestern is a super high-quality school (god im so fucking tired of how stuck up they are this fucking school oh my god), but none of the classes I took were even hard. To be fair, I didn't take anything like Bio or Chem - but I don't want to do science. I took a lot of writing/analysis classes & french bc im planning on majoring in comp lit, which is an exciting major to me - I love writing & I love learning languages. But none of the classes challenged me or made me feel like I was actually learning in any way. Yeah, I learned a new french verb tense and I wrote some essays, but really what it felt like was I sat down at my desk in the morning, zoned out and did homework for a while, and then suddenly it was dinnertime. every. single. day. The only class I feel I actually got something useful out of was my video game analysis class, which I went to office hours for basically every week and wrote extra essays and was friends with the professor and stuff. Every other class was just busywork. Honestly, I'm kind of mad I got all As bc god knows I just checked the boxes and moved on in some of those classes! and sure, that's all you need to do, but what is the point of taking these classes and dedicating so much time to them if it doesn't get me anywhere personally??? I spend 10 hours a week for a number on my transcript? I'm not LEARNING ANYTHING!!

I like to do a lot of stuff with my free time - I'm a writer, I create & edit my own videos, I draw/paint, as well as teaching myself Japanese, reading, playing games.... and I didn't have time to do any of that the way I wanted to. I just spent the vast majority of every single day doing some goddamn reading or discussion post & I wasn't able to do the things I actually care about.... and that fucking sucks. All of that stuff is more fulfilling to me and feels more important than any of my classes were - and I feel like I'm learning more too! but noooo ""respond to 3 people on canvas......"" I told myself that if college was anything like the full IB program did (no free time, constantly in ""survival mode,"" dont feel fulfilled or happy, just trying to get through to the next week), I would drop out.... and here I am and its exactly like that and I can't commit to transferring.

Also im spending 80,000 fucking dollars a year to go to this dumbass stuck up school with boring classes and busywork. WHAT AM I DOING. I literally asked my parents ""why am i spending so much to go to a school with mid classes"" and they said 'for the name on your diploma."" which is. correct. but so awful its so ughhhh.

I've had such a wonderful break - I've completed so many projects, including editing a movie-length game show, completing like 8 paintings, 2-3 books, seeing all my old friends all the time (and getting to actually be myself with them). I've started volunteering at my local museum teaching kids about trains, which is SO much fun & I love all the people there. I've finally picked up my viola again (which I'm not allowed to even play at college bc you have to be a music major to access the practice rooms.... 80k a year for THIS???)..... idk i just cant really deal with the idea of going back to the way things were. I haven't cried once since I got home a month ago, and I cried at school basically every other day. And I just accepted that as normal. I dont want to do that again.

But I don't know where I go from here. Any college ""easier"" than Northwestern is just going to be stupidly easy, and feels like admitting defeat.... ""ohhh they just couldnt cut it at northwesternn... how sad....""  Any college with a similar level of challenge might just have the same fucking issues and I don't know how to tell whether they would or not! and I don't even know how to begin to break it to my parents that I hate college.... I mentioned to them once that I needed to slack off more, in the sense that if I spent 30 minutes on each page of each reading I would go insane.... and the looks I got from across the dining room table were so disappointed. They're great, and they would support me wanting to transfer, but I don't know how they'd feel about this reason and it just... feels like admitting defeat. I got the highest grades of my whole graduating class - I'm supposed to be good at this shit... and I AM! but it doesnt even matter i just hate it.

TL:DR: I spend all my time every day on stupid things I don't care about, which makes me hate college. Nothing challenges me or forces me to learn and I never have time to do things I actually care about. Stressed to hell and back about having to do another trimester bc I don't want to go through that again.",Fire-Dragonn

In tech what is good path for someone non tech savvy would the ideal route be in i.t or computer science.

I love being able to choose what I do with my time and finally feeling like I can finally make decisions for myself. I love all of these things about it and yet I'm wondering if it's all a waste of time and money.

And that's because of the tuition. This college is in state and is one of the least expensive colleges to attend and yet we still can't really afford it. I have all of the financial aid possible (except for one due to issues with my fasfa app) and I have a scholarship and yet it's still so hard. I don't come from money and up until 2 years ago, my parent was making vastly below what should be livable. And even now it's still hard. And what makes it worse is how seemingly insignificant my problems are to the school. The financial office had been hounding me for weeks and I finally talked to them to given them an explanation that we don't have that kind of money and I'm working two jobs while being a full time student and they told me ""Atleast you have a plan!""

I know college is an investment and with my major, it could be a really good investment. But you need money to make really good investments and it feels like we have too little of it right now.

742,"Opposite of a rant, but a lesson",197,"TL;DR.- Professor rounded grade up (significantly - 0.6%) without being asked. Don't ask, and accept what they give you.

I am a non-traditional student and did what I would consider poorly on the final for a class (B-), but had done relatively well on all other aspects of the class, showed up to every class (online synchronous, which is important later), participated, and generally showed an interest in this required, gen-ed class. I'm in the ""night school"" of a major R1, which is a bit weird because traditional students have classes like this delivered in lecture halls, while we have small classes (by the end of the semester, there were about 10 in the class) and get to know the (mostly adjunct) faculty well.

One of the days that I showed up I was incredibly ill, but sat through the class anyway, and participated the best I could in the discussion.

At the end of the semester, as she was doing grades after the final, I got my grade for participation, which was more than 100% (which is probably right, because I was quite active in the class, and she commented even when I was sick how she would miss me since I was the only one that really engaged in the lecture - which convinced me to stay). Anyhow, after she put the final grade in, I have the LMS send me emails immediately on course updates. I saw she changed my participation grade again twice, both upwards, ending up 0.6% (of the final grade) higher than what she had initially put in. I thought it odd until I looked at the grade book and computed my final grade for the class. She was doing what she could to make sure I got an A in the class despite my abysmal performance on the final. I didn't ask her to do this and certainly wasn't expecting it. Thanks to that, my 4.0 is preserved even after this difficult class.

That being said, if we removed both RMP and course evals, what space do students have to vent/rant? Even group chats, sometimes professors lurk in there. So where is our space?

Edit: Apparently this email is grade grubbing. FFS I don’t get it.

“Was hoping for some clarification on your policy surrounding the rounding of grades. The syllabus uses whole numbers so I was unsure if my grade would be an A with rounding or an A- without. Any information is appreciated.”

748,grade dropped after final paper,5,"*im on mobile so please excuse the formatting 

my final paper in my psychology experimental research class was just graded. i went from a 97% overall to an 87%. i know i should feel grateful that i at least passed the class, and trust me i am.

the thing is i had a really shitty time during last fall semester. i was burnt out of my previous major, fell into the deepest depression i've ever felt, developed an ED, dropped all my courses, switched my major and even then ended the spring semester with a couple C's and a D.

i feel like im finally in a good place. i'm happy and healthy and really succeeding but i know that when next year comes around and im applying to grad programs im gonna need something to show for all the W's, D's, C's and grade replacements on my transcript. im finally doing good and proving myself but it feels like any slip up could jeopardize everything im working towards.

751,What to ask college advisor about your academics path?,2,"



For many months I have told myself I'm going to contact my advisor and just talk about my academics but really don't know how to approach and I had a conversation before in I just feel very overwhelmed because I'm not getting any guideline or any clarity. The program I wanted to pursue was a radiology and she said change your path to something else and I'm just completely lost because I was completing the prereqs and at this point don't know what to do.
I haven't taken any classes this year ever since the summer semester. And now that a new semester is about to begin next year, I feel like I should get back on a track and focus on my academics so I can better my life. But I feel so hesitant to reach out because I know that I'm not going to get any clarity from my advisor and just feel really overwhelmed from inside. Like what should I do now? I thought about talking on what alternative pets there are or based on my pre-rex completed. Are there any other programs that I could look into or what should I do honestly?.",Jpoolman25
752,Post semester,7,"My semester just ended 2 days ago and it was a weird one. I had a hard time adjusting as I was coming from more online classes than  in person, to now all online.

My health I took just as an elective, turns out the lady was batshit insane.  I went in with the mindset that I couldn’t fail any classes because 2 of them aren’t offered until next fall, and I’m graduating in the spring.

Well I did it, I finished. Now sure when the grades are posted but I know 3/4 are passed and for all the work I did on my final that one Professor cannot fail me.

756,Professor gave me an A even though I didn’t do most of the work.,69,"TLDR: I got an A in English and I’m upset. 



I feel like he probably gave the whole class an A. It was an easy, asynchronous course that was just literature through the films of the 60s and 70s. It was actually mostly fun and classic movies. No class times, no meetings, no lectures, etc. We just watched stuff like Scorsese and Spielberg films on our own time. You were supposed to write a 300 word discussion post summarizing the movie and answering whatever few questions he gave. 



I only did a few of them and as I was finishing up another post I noticed he already entered the final grade in as an A. He honestly forgot about our class a lot. He even forgot to post something a couple times so you went a couple weeks without any work (not that I’m complaining.) I genuinely enjoyed the course as most of the movies were really good and I essentially just paraphrased and edited what I had already written in my Letterboxd reviews for the films. It’s just nice to have that easy A and I just really wanted to share that with someone. 

I failed English in my first semester of college because it was just genuinely so much work for me. The professor gave us all these ridiculously long books to read, short amounts of time for discussion posts, such weird foreign films that nobody would watch unless it was homework (it was genuinely shocking how many of the books and films had long incestuous plot lines), and so many essays. How she managed to get to 4 stars on rate my professor baffled me. 


My ADHD was a big issue for me and still is, but English was the only class I failed my first semester. I just hate myself for not picking this professor’s course. Ever since I failed English that first semester I’ve been an anxious wreck. In my second semester I was so overwhelmed by the prospect of failing that I failed two classes. 


As a result I lost my scholarship. The only way I could get it back is by getting my gpa back up which I can’t this semester cuz of how much I screwed up so now I gotta go another semester paying for my expensive private college. I didn’t even want to go to this school. I would’ve been perfectly happy going to the city college paying less than a 1000 bucks a semester. Now I got this constant pressure. I don’t even know what I’ll do if I failed again. Maybe I’m being irrational by id just give up at that point.


I almost failed chem for a second time but had to beg my professor to give me an extension. They took so long to respond. The day I got that email that I wouldn’t be able to pass for a second time I didn’t sleep for 30 hours. I just kept having panic attacks every 20 minutes. I was so nauseous that I couldn’t eat and was using the bathroom every 20 minutes as stress triggers a gastrointestinal disease I have. I eventually calmed down but I honestly didn’t know I could feel that way. I just wanted to yell and scream all the air out of my lungs. I had to force myself to look at family photos for an hour to convince myself why I shouldn’t end it. 

It’s just so upsetting that this downward spiral all started because of that fucking English class. 


I guess maybe it wasn’t like that. I’ve been at risk of failing classes since my freshman year of high school. I keep trying to blame it on one event when I realize the real issue is my habits just aren’t sustainable. 

I’ve been doing therapy since before the semester and it hasn’t really helped. Neither have meds. I’m hust really upset and don’t know what to do. I want to change my habits but I don’t know if I trust myself as this is gonna be my fourth semester. Maybe I’m just writing this cuz I’m anxious and don’t want to go to sleep before my last final.

I know that next semester I can take an equivalent or the same class (possibly) to finally ""graduate"", but it's very disheartening to know that in reality me walking at my graduation ceremony meant for nothing.

758,My instructor barely graded anything the entire semester,164,"This was for chemistry. We had 1-2 labs due a week. 100+ point quizzes that took the entire lecture period that most people didn’t finish. Exams felt unreasonably hard with very little to prepare us for the types of questions that were asked. 

We had 3 quizzes with over 300 points total  from October through December not graded before we took the final. Not even our first post lab from august was graded. Day of the final, the instructor says labs will almost entirely be graded on completion. A little bit annoying to have spent so much time on them, but at least I’ll get mostly full credit, right? Nope. I’ve only gotten full credit on one of them, despite knowing I answered every single question. 

I’m so frustrated. How are we supposed to improve our post labs if we never get any feedback? How do we know where we stand in the class with so many points on the table? Whenever someone would ask about when we would get things back it was always “I have a lot to grade” and yet you’re not grading any of it! I’ve been sadly watching my grade drop all day as post labs are graded, with no feedback on why points are gone. I worked so hard on this class all semester, just to watch my B drop lower and lower, and knowing there is nothing I can do to stop it. 

TLDR: my instructor barely graded anything through the semester and now there’s nothing we can do except watch our grades drop",Lbrint

760,How do I figure out what degree I want to pursue?,5,"Sorry if this is a dumb or unanswerable or overdone question. I'm just really having a tough time right now. My (31M) life has been in shambles for pretty much the entirety of it. Been unemployed more often than not. Severe, untreated mental illness. Etc.

I finally decided to go back to school this semester for the first time in 12 years, just to do something instead of doing nothing like I'm so sick of. I got good grades, but it was pure hell. I've been working literally 16 hours a day, 7 days a week (taking 14 credits). I can't focus to save my life and I couldn't comprehend the material whatsoever. I basically BS'd my way into straight A's and it's a miracle that I was able to.

I'm pretty confident that the main sources of my problems were A) that I was doing online classes, and B) that I can't work alone! I am not the least bit self-motivated and my attention span makes my reading comprehension terrible. I just can't sit here and teach myself math & chemistry & history by reading a billion pages of boring, monotonous, black & white text on a screen/book. It's so boring I'd rather die. I'm positive I have ADHD. But state-sponsored health insurance only covers behavioral health facilities that specialize in drug addiction so they refuse to prescribe ADHD meds.

That's another thing, I have literally no idea what I'm doing or anything about college. I just know it's a place where you go to learn stuff. I have no idea which degrees mean what, which ones are worthless vs profitable, which departments and activities I should be looking into, if any. I'm just so lost. I took a ""college exploration and university transfer"" class that taught me nothing. It was just a bunch of generic ""you need to be responsible and work hard and manage your money and take your classes"" stuff like that.

But my main concern is I just have no idea what degree I want to pursue. My main passion is I guess either psychology or social science? I want to shed light on people's deepest biases, flaws, etc (yes, including my own) and open people's eyes to our problems and shortcomings. I want to make a significant and positive difference in this era so characterized by hatred, illness/instability, division, etc. I want to conduct studies/polls and prove theories with data.

But on the other hand, I'm willing to do literally anything and really just want to make good money (duh). And I'm at least somewhat confident that I'm capable of doing whatever it takes, even if it means some science degree that requires insanely high levels of math. (I don't mind algebra so much, it's geometry and word problems that I loathe). Sorry for the rant no one's gonna want to read.

TL;DR - 1: I have no idea what I'm doing or anything about school. I'm struggling so badly, mostly due to loneliness and a shot attention span. 2: I need to make up my mind on a degree but don't know how (the personality/profiler tests have taught me nothing btw). 3: I want to study psychology and human behavior and put our biggest problems in the spotlight. 4: I'm willing to do just about any job/degree if it pays well.

761,I hate honors college / possible trigger?,11,"The honors college has its perks, sure. It gives benefits and opens the doors in ways I would have never imagined and makes me feel confident that I will find a place in my career.

I just turned one in that didn’t meet the page requirements because I’m so tired and I’m already dealing with health issues, while my mini-mester classes  are started. Also there is so much drama from the people that resembles highschool stuff that I’ve avoided most of the group. I’m probably going to leave it after spring semester, but I don’t have a choice if I don’t receive any other full rides to continue my education. Idk. Also the honors director doesn’t do anything about the students who are harassing and being discriminatory to other students even when he witnesses it, but will barrage the good students based on rumors. Is anyone else in an honors college and if so how is that working out for you? Is it more organized and less stressful?

I’ll have to retake it next semester, but I really want to take a break. However, my parents said that I couldn’t live with them if I dropped out, even for a semester. So I guess I’m stuck.

763,I've been an idiot and loser my entire academic life,56,"It all goes back to me being a little kid living in the bubble world. I got As in elementary school (I mean duh). During middle school is when for the first time, teachers actually started grading stuff. I failed my first ever class during 8th grade (it was English), because I lost my book so I didn't do any of the reading questions. Teacher said it wasn't a valid excuse (It wasn't but I was a middle schooler thinking that that was a valid excuse). By this point, my grades have already dropped to mostly Bs. I was pretty lazy so bad grades made sense.

Now, it's high school. 9th grade, my grade was alright, slightly better, had some As and Bs. Didn't last long because 10th grade, my grade tanked and I got all Bs before they started doign the pass fail stuff. 11th grade was bad, I got Bs and Cs, and only one A. 12th grade was horrible too, getting Bs and Cs, and again only one A. Btw, that one A is just Spanish class. Tbf, I didn't study a lot and turned in my assignments late a lot, but whatever the case was, even if I did try hard, I always seemed to struggle to get an A.

Well, finally, it's college. You can tell from my grade that I didn't exactly get into a top tier university. Nevertheless, I got into CS major for an UC. I started to work harder, got all As during my first quarter. That felt good especially since it had been like 7 years since I got straight As. 2nd quarter came around and I declined getting all Bs. I was lazier and just didn't put in the work as hard as I did 1st quarter. 3rd quarter came, I tried harder initially but got lazier as summer inched by, and failed 2 of my finals, which caused me to fail a class and went from A+ to C in one of my classes. That was the worst quarter to date, I was devastated, but I eventually accepted it because I was indeed lazy during that quarter and didn't really put in the work.

Sophomore year, I knew I needed to work harder. At first, I did the same thing, but halfway through, I started to go to office hours more often eventually all the time. I started to allocate more time for studying. But in the end, I still got Bs and Cs. To top it off I failed a final again, but this time I actually spent like 2 to 3 weeks studying for it. I felt like huge loser. Ok, when I got a bad grade while I was lazy, I knew deep down that it was because I'm lazy, but now maybe I'm just a stupid piece of shit.

What's worse is showing my parents my grade. It's always the same. ""You have no future blah blah blah"". ""You're gonna be homeless"" Never once whenever I got a bad grade, did they ever try to comfort me that it's okay and that I can do better. Never. They always said I was a loser and that I'm gonna die alone on the streets if stuff like this happened. Well, today, they saw my grades for this quarter, and the same lecture ensued, but they just assumed I was playing video games and partying and stuff. FYI, I had not play video games since high school and I don't party at all. I have like zero social life besides going to the gym and rock climbing. They said I got a bad grade because my attitude was trash and that I never bothered to try hard. I mean, wow. I went to office hours, try to seek help this quarter a lot and I still got a bad grade, you think I wouldn't feel bad? I don't know man. Maybe my attitude really is bad, but I can tell you that getting Bs and Cs your whole life while getting yelled at for getting such grades your entire life is not a good feeling. I'm just an idiot and a loser, or both.

TL;DR I always got bad grades as a kid, and even when I put in the work, I still mostly get shit grades. Parents always said I was a loser and was gonna end up nowhere with my grades.",Independent_Peace144
764,I've tried contacting my advisor but she's on break.,0,"So, this is a follow up to a post I did earlier. Basically, I got academic suspension. I got a letter from the school explaining what I should do next. I should meet up with my advisor to discuss my future plans when I return and they have the power to lift/override registration holds.

I tried to schedule an appointment with my advisor but the first available time is on January 24th which is one week after class already starts and therefore too late. I then sent an email to my advisor explaining my situation and requested that we meet as soon as possible. I immediately got an automated email reply back explaining that she's on break and that she won't respond to emails until January 2nd. In the automated email reply, it told me to register and pay for classes in my student portal but I can't fucking do that because I have a registration holds! I guess on January 2nd, there's still technically time to resolve this but it cutting it pretty fucking close! I was hoping I would meet my advisor and get the registration holds lifted so I can register for classes and then I'll do the SAP appeal.

I just wanted this Spring to be a normal semester. I originally got on academic probation because of low GPA. I raised my GPA, so I thought I'll be off the hook but now I'm not earning enough credits and they immediately put me in academic suspension and placed a registration hold. I'm so close too. If I earned 1 more credit, I would be in good standing and I wouldn't be in this mess.

But for the first time, I’ve found myself missing high school. I don’t regret much of what I did do. But I do regret a whole heck of a lot of stuff I didn’t do. I missed out on a lot of experiences that I’ll never get back. 

Finally getting to sit still and not think about class has me dwelling on what I’ve been doing with my young life. And it’s just a ton of waste.

Worst part is I’m not doing any better now. Everybody asks me if I have friends and if I hang out often. I just lie and say yes. I don’t have a clique. Nothing.

I played a season of club tackle football and had some fun. But no friends from that. I’m cool with my AFROTC wingmen, but we don’t talk outside of it. And outside of that, I just went to class (barely) and stayed in my room.

I’m just lost I guess. This break has also got me reconsidering my major. I want to let it sit with me for awhile before I just and make a decision I can’t change.

I go to a school of 50,000 and I have nobody. That’s statistical anomaly. 

You’d think I’d use all this alone time to study, but no. I can’t even say that’s hurt me at this point cuz I’ll probably have a 3.6. But I know my lack of work ethic is going to catch up.

I can’t stop dwelling on my past or future. I’m everywhere but the present. I’m an overthinking mess. And I’m self aware of all of this but I’ll probably continue doing it because I’m self destructive.

770,I fudged my intro to international politics final (as a prospective IR major!),5,"Disclaimer: I apologize for the very long post (conciseness is not my strong suit) and bad grammar bc i am half asleep.

Context: this final is open note, open book, and online. It's worth a whopping 40% of my grade, so even the very low A in the class \*\*including the 2% worth of extra credit\*\* that I have going into the final is not enough of a safety cushion to save my grade. I had a huge time window to take it (December 8-18) and I decided to take it on December 18 at 1 am (my first mistake already.) The due date was 5 pm today but I also have a final from 2-5 pm for my history class so I figured I'd do the final before I sleep and not when I get up the next morning to reserve some studying time for my history final. Well well well, it sure looks like I won't be getting any sleep after this!

More context: I had a very long break between my previous exam (December 13) until now. I obviously should have used that time to settle down and study like a normal person, but I found every way to do absolutely nothing between December 13 and now. I was upset about one of my first two exam results and overall class grade, which I had already received (just barely an A-), and I was kinda just done with everything after my first two exams despite having three more and being, again, right on the edge of an A and an A- in two out of three classes, including this one. My ability to have the basic executive functioning to study just went completely out the window somehow, and it was quite clear in my mind what I had to do and how I had to study to prepare for this class, I just didn't *do* what I knew I needed to do. I went to the TA review session for this class on the last day, and we were given three possible prompts for the essay portion, one of which would show up on the exam. Easy peasy - I just create very detailed outlines for all three prompts and pretty much just put it all into paragraph form when I actually do the essay. *Maybe* prewriting all three essays could have also been an option (is this veering into academically dishonest territory though)? I didn't do any of that though, I was just so demotivated and this crucial mistake led to the absolute shitshow that was the essay portion of my exam. I'm also really upset because I was supposed to go to a tutoring session for this class to refresh concepts and prepare for the writing portion but it got canceled due to a tech error on my end which didn't allow me to see the zoom link that my tutor gave me, that's neither here nor there though at this point :( But essentially I didn't actually study and I am finally paying the price for that, I have been able to get through the 2 quizzes and midterm fine enough just by going to every lecture and taking extremely detailed notes (again: everything is open book/open note), but the final was when it all came crashing down.

**Oh boy, here's how it went**:

My final exam was split up into the following portions: multiple choice (30%), matching (10%), 3 IDs, 5-7 sentences each (10% each, so 30% in total), and the 3 paragraph essay (30%!!!) So, if I'm not being a colossal idiot, the absolute first thing I should do after opening the exam is that I should check how many points each section is worth. I didn't do that, and because I didn't do that and instead just went through the exam in order, I thought it would be a \~great idea\~ to focus most of my energy on the multiple choice. When taking previous exams for this class, I got fucked on the multiple choice portion more than anything else, and even when I was in a massive time crunch by the time I got to the written section, I still did a near perfect job most of the time. That was not the case here.

I took my sweet time on the MC and matching portions (55! out of 85 minutes total), and I kinda already knew it was over for me when I had 30 minutes to do the entirety of the written section. I did the IDs and I guess they were complete enough, but they took me 20 more minutes to write and I was left with 9 minutes to write 3 paragraphs worth 30% of my final exam grade WITHOUT AN OUTLINE OR PREPARATION!!! I knew that no matter what kind of voodoo magic I pulled out of my ass, there was absolutely no chance on God's good earth that I would finish, I simply did not have that writing speed. And I was right - I didn't finish the three paragraphs. I wrote two really short and bad ones, and I also didn't complete all the requirements of the prompt. The prompt (actually all prompts which I could choose from) asked me to take a stand on a debate among scholars of international politics which we learned about in class and justify my reasoning one way or the other. I didn't do either of those things :) I only had time to summarize both sides of the argument, without even including specific examples because I'm that braindead. The time ran out as soon as I wrote ""I agree with (Professor X)..."" (I think I remember misspelling a part of that sentence horribly because of last minute typos.) At this point I should be thrilled to even get a 15/30 on the essay portion bc holy shit fudge fridge mother of god

I'm upset, that's clear here, but please don't give me sympathy. I know I fucked up massively by not studying during the whole 5 day break between my first two exams and my last three *among other things which I mentioned in my post*. I am still fucking up as I write this post now at 4:45 am instead of sleeping and getting my shit together enough on a basic level to study for my history and political theory finals. No college student worth their salt should have executive dysfunction so horrible that *studying*, the thing we're THERE TO DO, just doesn't happen despite having nothing in the way of doing so. There's being a disaster and then... there's whatever this is.

The reason I post this, though, is that as stated in the title I have (had? should I speak in past tense now?) every plan to declare an IR major. Oh boy, oh boy, I didn't think anything could shake these plans, but here we are. My initial reaction after this exam was that I was about to be so disappointed with my grade because it doesn't reflect the \~passion\~ I have for the class material, which I shouldn't understate - international politics is already so fascinating to me and the class content covered a scope of subjects far beyond what I was expecting. It worked my brain like nothing else, but at the same time, when it came down to proving my understanding of the material, I didn't put in enough effort. I showed up to class and took detailed notes, sure, but I didn't review outside of class, refresh my understanding of concepts, go to tutoring or office hours or anything else, and I even stopped doing the readings about halfway into the semester. So now I'm thinking: if I really was passionate about the course material, I would put in more effort. Essentially I'm discovering that I'm not as passionate about IR as I thought I was, and combined with my shitshow political theory essay from last month that I am still waiting on a grade/feedback for, my confidence in the areas of study I thought I was most interested in (IR/political science) is broken. I had (unrealistic and unfounded) aspirations of becoming an academic in those areas of study, and now I'm fully realizing I don't have the chops for that even if there's nothing else I'd \~rather\~ be doing. I'm thinking I should just give up and do STEM instead because at this point, I'm so far gone when it comes to the skills needed for IR and politics that I would be better at pretty much anything else. I don't know what to do now, do you have any advice for my situation?

I am also in my *third year*! and a transfer student who is only now taking intro courses bc my previous college was very specialized and didn't have any politics or IR courses at all! this makes my situation even more dire

Edit: i just copy and pasted a previous post i wrote on another subreddit before it was taken down by mods oops, but now it is midday the next day and i \*barely\* got sleep but i havent studied for my global history final bc i'm stupid and also that shit raised my blood pressure tremendously

TL;DR is it over for me? should i just start over yet again and switch to STEM or even something else entirely like art or theatre? bc i think it's clear at this point that i'm not going to be an academic no matter how many times i tell myself that's what i wanna do, no matter how much i glorify it for myself, no matter how much i read academic texts or hang out in academic circles or blah blah blah blah. i still can't put in the basic effort to do work of minimally good quality, even after three years of college... should i, god forbid, drop out? maybe this college thing isn't even right for me at all.

771,How do I say no to my flatmate asking for food,213,"im a bit of a people pleaser and i really dont know how to say no. my flatmate is signed into the university meal plan, but I'm not because i cant afford it. she also is doing way better off than me financially, she is the type to travel abroad every vacation meanwhile I've never left my country. for anyone wondering how we are at the same university, i took out a loan while her parents are paying hers.

she asks me for food pretty often and i dont know how to say no cause she's actually a very nice person. what tipped me off just earlier is she asked me if i have milk even tho she also has some! she took my last bit even though she has two full bottles of the same brand. i don't see the need of taking mine when she has her own.

how do i nicely tell her no the next time she asks? i thought of saying ""im sorry but i dont have any"" but she could probably see in the fridge or in my drawers that i do have",averageboydestroyer

I start on one path and deviate like crazy then wrap it all back around. Some of the worst work I’ve ever done. I have zero energy to try to make it better. 

Everything about this class has been so repetitive that I feel like I’m losing my mind. I’ve definitely written about the same three topics at least four times each and I’m running out of ways to frame the content. I also have no interest in this specific area of my degree. Combined, it is making for some shitty work.

775,My Professor can't manage to do his job,16,"I took five classes this semester at a community college. This past week was finals week. The grades in my classes were due on Friday the 15th. Four of my professors did their jobs and got everything graded on time or ahead of time, so I know exactly how I finished in those classes, which is great. This one idiot, on the other hand STILL has only graded 8 out of 13 assignments. I'd just love for this fool to do his job so I can figure out my final  grade in that class, because not having 5 assignments graded is so unbelievably unacceptable and unprofessional.

On a side note, one of the assignments was turned in on the 15th of November, and still isn't graded. He's so poor at his job that there have been multiple instances where a grade hasn't come back within a month.",chilidig
776,I studied for the entire week yet I still failed my exam.,220,"it was for physics. The entire finals week, I dedicated at least 2 to 3 hours a day to it. I went to every single office hours and two days before I basically studied the entire day. When I got the exam, I realized that it was wayy harder than I thought, but I hoped for the best that I could maybe at least get a 70 or above

I got itback today only to see a fat 50% on it; Wow, I shouldn't have even studied. Because guess what score I got during my first quarter physics last year when I didn't study at all? Also 50%. All that hardwork fornothing. I hate myself so much now. I will pass the class for sure since I calculated that I need a 10% on the exam to fail the class but still. Wtf.

777,I have a professor who keeps writing fake reviews for himself on RMP,307,"Unfortunately, I fell for the fake reviews when I took him last year. 

I went into the class so enthusiastic and excited because I had so many good experiences with previous professors in the same department. The professor I took before this dude had a 4.5/5 and I was blown away by how amazing the lectures were. The 4.5 rating professor had a full lecture classroom from beginning to end.

And this fake review writing dude had 5/5 and a larger number of reviews. I thought I was going to get even more blown away by how good he was going to be.

Safe to say, I came out the other end extremely disappointed. There were only like 7 people coming to lecture by week 3. The lectures were soooooooo bad.

On top of that, he literally spent the whole semester complaining about how his department kicked him out of lab coordinator duty because they didn't like the way he did things. And for whatever reason, when you asked him for feedback his answer would be ""oh, I can't tell you that..."" His class was depressing AF.

I got a B in the class, but studying for it destroyed my life during that semester. He based it off his own terribly written material and refused to use the well organized textbook that his department has chosen. I mean, he spent the whole semester just complaining about how he's mistreated by the department.

I use RMP regularly to make decisions on who I take, which is why I contribute to it. I wrote a fair and legit 3/5 review for him providing my fellow classmates on what to REALLY expect. It wasn't even a maliciously written review because I also included some nice things about him in there too.

As soon as I posted the review, it got reported. And then, somebody (I'm assuming the professor himself) immediately writes a 5/5 review basically responding to the review I wrote and telling me to change my major.

Then, I noticed he started loading up RMP to try to bury my review. There's even a fake review saying he's handsome (he's an obese, balding dude with no lips). That's what gave it away for me. I've kept an eye on his RMP page and I've noticed the same thing happens whenever a real review gets posted. Like, someone will write a 3/5 review and then a bunch of 5/5 reviews will get loaded up right after... and the 5/5 reviews always use the same language: ""he's a gem"" ""he's the best of our school"" 

As a real student, I've never written a professor is ""the best"" of our school because I only usually take classes once so there's no way I would know who is the best at teaching the class.

And yes im gonna let the professor know you aren’t contributing. You wanna screw yourself over? Fine, I don’t care, but don’t drag me into it. My grade shouldn’t suffer because of your laziness and selfishness. You’re annoyed? Too bad.

No I’m not gonna “help you out” and give you the answers to #3,4,6,7,9,10 and 11 on the homework. Why don’t you try doing it yourself or ask the professor for help? It’s not my fault you didn’t pay attention. “But friends help other friends.” No, I’m not your friend. We only talk because we sit next to each other and you only text me outside of class when you want something. That’s not a friend. I’ll bet 50 bucks I will not hear from you after this semester because my usefulness to you ran out. So no we are not friends. You’re annoyed? Too bad.

“Fine! Don’t come to me when you need help!” Don’t worry. I won’t. I don’t want “help” from someone who admitted they are afraid that they will fail the class. 

The only person at this university that has my best interest at heart is me. I’m gonna do what it takes for me to succeed. I’m not selfish for setting boundaries. And if this post makes you mad, it’s about you.

Update: thankfully the prof (from the class that inspired part of this post) is grading those who actually contributed separately from the person who didn’t. Is the other person pissed that they were cut from the group? Probably. I’ll never know bc they never bothered to communicate with us but in the end, I don’t care.

Why wasn't the assignment set like that on Canvas then?.... I'm not sure if i can do anything about it now, but I'll try, and I'm also convinced it was the professor's fault.... Never sending an announcement to clarify like a good teacher would or anything.",Historical_Driver_87
780,Failed Education System,10,"Well, lets talk about the failed education system of India. I love coding, and can do maths, hence I took Computer Science and Engineering. In Indian engineering colleges, they teach you everything except coding. Also the first year is full of crap subjects, where you have zero coding subjects. Coming onto second year, they ensure you mug up stuff and vomit it in the exam paper so that you can never perform in the actual coding rounds of companies. Instead of focusing more on data structures and algorithms, development, machine learning,etc. (which are useful and related to computer science), they go on to teach useless subjects like microcontrollers and microprocessors. I mean if I had interest in this subject then I would've taken electronics, right!? BUT NO, these guys want that we should be jack of all trades. They teach all this useless subjects and then cry about their students not performing in companies coding rounds.   
After these four years, I'll ensure that I'LL NEVER EVER pursue any education from this failed education system. There is a reason why India produces more engineers than USA, China, and is still so under-developed. The main aim of colleges are to ensure the students attend their classes, where the professors teach like brain-dead donkeys, and submit assignments, practical files, lab write-ups, lab codes,etc. They have the potential to mess up an interesting subject and eventually make it extremely boring.   
I have solved 100 questions on leetcode and am about to finish supervised ML. That's the most productive things I've done in this 2 years of college. I just feel shameful that I've developed so little skills in my 2 years of college. God help this education system.",aadi022005

I've lost points for not stating which rule I used to solve a question (even if the work made it obvious), or not writing down every variable I was using on a visual I made for my own reference. Even after studying a lot more than I usually would, I never got better than a C on any test, at least not before a curve, which she apparently isn't going to do for the final.

I've never failed a class ever...and because I should be taking the next course in the sequence next semester, failing would delay my graduation by a year.

I need a 74 on the final to pass with a D (I am allowed to pass with one D in the program.) This is so embarrassing and I've never had such a low grade in any class ever, but this class has kicked my ass. I feel like there's barely any resources for this content and the professor isn't good at teaching. I'm really trying to buckle down and understand what I can, but it isn't looking good for me. I know I could've tried harder for my first two exams as well, but I've been so checked out mentally this semester.

I feel like I'd be embarrassed if I had to take this again too, because not only would I not be graduating and my entire next semester would be fucked up, but I'd be embarrassed to see the same professor again after that. Part of me is convinced I'll just drop out if I fail but I have no real plan if I do that either.

They’ve resorted to adding an extra bed in already cramped dorms and creating a standard of living that even a prisoner would scoff at.

My god is it hard. To preface, my high school was a joke when it comes to math (vocational school for economics which explains why our math department was horrendous)

We didn't do trigonometry, limits, logs, vectors and a whole lot of other things. And sadly these are the main things we are currently doing.  I have only had three exams up until know. To be honest the first one I made 2 stupid mistakes which cost me a third of the points. Second did well enough.

But this newest one. I. Knew. Nothing. I studied really hard. We were given exams from previous years. I did them all and studied them thoroughly, understood everything well enough. Then we got a test that was way harder than any of the previous ones.


Like exponentially harder.... and I did not do anything.  Tried some things that would have worked for the previous exams. Nope nothing.

I am furious, sad, disappointed and so many other emotions that I cannot name them all. I was a straight A student in high school. The valedictorian. Yet I come here, and am absolutely useless... The bottom of the barrel when it comes to math knowledge.

This one single test ruined my confidence (which was already low enough) and is making me question my major. I knew it was going to be extremely hard. But I believed that it was possible that I could get back on track and be level with my peers. Can I do this? I am not so sure anymore...

Now here is the embarrassing part. I sat in the corner furthest away from the teacher's table so nobody could see me unless they turned their heads around. In the corner there was a trash can and... I really don't know why I thought of this... But I decided to have a ninja shit in the classroom.

When I'm doing a test I usually like to have a mountain of papers to scribble on. So I thought that I could use some of it to shit on. I took some paper and slowly slid it down my pants. Then I released my bowels...

The shit clumped up on the thick layer of paper and when satisfied I took out the papers to throw it in the trash bin. But just as I smeared the shit all over my ass and aimed for the trash can, a classmate who sat next to me saw me. And this classmate wasn't just an ordinary classmate, it was my childhood crush. She saw the shit-filled anal mucus paper wrap and instantly puked. To my demise the whole class looked back to see my hands in the air holding that burrito of pure shit.

Everybody I know has heard what happened and I've been getting roasted 24/7 since the incident yesterday and I'm not sure what to do.

I thought I just needed to apply, then FAFSA and my school's FA office will deal with it. What should be a simple procedure turned into an administration nightmare. I already confirmed with FAFSA 5 times that my school received my FAFSA application and SAR report to their database since it was processed successfully a month ago. Yet my school keeps claiming that they don't have my record and said they will send in a request to FAFSA. Turned out  my school's FA office  never sent in an official request to FAFSA for my application.

I remember jumping through the multiple hoops to ensure it was actually cancelled. Today I was charged again anyway and I went to check to see if my subscription was canceled and it wasn’t so I cancelled it again and they used that against me.  I contacted them and all they said was “It will cancel next month, but good news, you have access until it’s canceled!” or, “There is nothing I can do. Anymore questions?” It’s so frustrating because I know I canceled but I can’t get a refund. And I need to buy groceries. As a broke student I was looking forward for my little check all week knowing it wasn’t going to be that much because I called off of work to study for my finals. It to have to starve until next week is so humiliating. I feel like Chegg is such a scam because I was told by a chat person that there was a “unusually high volume of calls today”.

Edit: A chat person randomly texted me again hours after the initial conversation. They couldn’t help me so I asked about the usage on my account. I was told it makes me ineligible for a refund. I asked when was the usage because I haven’t used it in weeks and the new cycle began today. Multiple times this person ignored my question to send the same automated message until I was told that the usage is measured by an automated system and humans do not have access to see when we use our account.

It really annoyed me because its almost like she doesn’t want me in there at all. She is a light sleeper as well so throughout the semester I’ve been heavily policed on the noise i make in the dorm. I literally had to adapt to everything in her liking, but the same breath she does the same stuff that she doesn’t want me to do. Like i close the door quietly because of her, but she would happily let the door slam, idk if she thinks i’m a deep sleeper but she hasn’t been considerate to me as a person. She also can be quite rude sometimes. I brushed up against her  accidentally while packing and i said sorry, and idk if she didn’t hear me cause her headphones were on, but she said ugh can’t you say excuse like geez, in a pretty annoyed and rude tone.

791,I really hate how I feel stuck since I'm not allowed to continue my education,12,"I come from low income family so education is very important to me. It wasn't just education but experiencing being with my peers. You may asked why is that important to me. Well let's just say I didn't have a good foundation or support from family neither could I connect well with my peers due to anxiety and depression. I've seen college as a way to reconnect with my peers for the last time. A way for me to reach out my comfort zone, I wanted to be student advisor or create fun inclusive clubs. Hoping to improve my own social  anxiety and depression.

Moving on my main issue was the fact I was naive to choose a school out of state due to it's recognition throughout the country. It's a big school in Pennsylvania is all I'm going to say. I had amazing grades in high school, wasn't perfect to my standard due to COVID back in year 2019-2020. I went to their summer program hoping for a better opportunity in my life. Only for it to crumble upon me. My issue wasn't so much of grades but going to school without cosigner. At first my family supported me going to college for Economics then all sudden they didn't care at all. They gave me phone call telling me we're hoping you stay home and get a job to help us with bills. To see so many kids have their parents support even from out of state kinda made me sad the fact nobody in my family cared about my future. At the same time I'm at fault too for not  informing myself enough to make these choices on my own. In my current life I'm stuck with student loans between 8-17k for attending one semester. Although I have payment plan with the school, they won't allow me to receive my official transcript until I pay 100% of what I owe. What sucks is that I won't finish paying them off until the exact year I'm supposed to graduate. Forcing me to stay home, work in a job that doesn't pay enough for me to even afford paying them back.

792,Going to a local commuter university sucked.,22,"This is just going to be a rant. I'm currently about to finish college and with a degree I believe has been worthwhile, but one of my biggest regrets is staying home for college.

I made friends during my time in school, but not like real *best* friends. Everyone's usually too busy or lives too far for that, since we're all commuters. I really wish I had a community of friends like people I know who went away for college and made long-lasting friendships.

I'm about to close out this chapter of my life but it definitely feels bittersweet. I'm glad to be nearly done with it all but I won't say it was a good experience overall.

794,I can't do this anymore,13,"Hello,

I'm a Pharmacy student in my 4th year, and although I knew what I was getting myself into when I started this journey, I never imagined living such a nightmare.

From day one, back in 2020, our teachers made it clear that it was one of the most difficult programs, and man they weren't joking, for the past 4 years, I've been pulling all nighters on a regular basis, studying every single day for hours, I have no social life, no hobby, no will to even work out because I'm so exhausted that whenever I find an hour or two, the only thing I want to do is lay on my bed and do absolutely nothing at all.

The worst part is it's been getting worse year after year, to a point where I now have to remember 100 courses per trimester, each one being 50 to 100 pages long, and I just can't do this anymore, I'm literally starting to go insane, my mind is foggy all the time, I have multiple breakdowns and panic attacks every day during which I start crying uncontrollably, I feel anxious all the time, I'm living off 4 hours of sleep at best, I sometimes even end up hitting myself because I get overwhelmed by all of this, it's a living nightmare.

This is not a way of living life, I haven't felt happy in years, I feel miserable and I can feel myself slowly going completely crazy, I don't know what to do at this point, I'm so tired of this bs.

795,My mom is not proud,161,"I've always wanted my Bachelor's. I went to community college for seven semesters, paid almost nothing (I got a few Cal Grants and also used my covid relief check to pay for tuition). I finished debt-free with a 3.7 GPA, got my AA-T, and just got accepted into a CSU last night. I will be starting as a junior.
I'm hoping I get some kind of scholarship or grant since I'm first-gen and from a low-income family. I know scholarships are hard to get, but I'll try anything to get some financial aid. That $30k a year tuition worries me, but I know it could be so much worse.

My mom is not happy for me. The first thing she said was: ""But you don't know anyone who goes to that school."" 
Nope, I don't, but I could always make friends. 
Then she asked ""But where are you going to live??"" 
Um, the college has dorms. My mom clearly knows this because her sister went to the same college decades ago and my mom used to spend the night at her dorm when visiting her.
THEN my mom asked me ""but HOW are you going to get to class every day??? What mode of transportation do you have that will take you from your dorm to class? You don't have a car. Are you going to WALK?"" 
Um, YES! I HAVE TWO WORKING LEGS! It'll take me like 15 mins max to get from my dorm room to class, or maybe 5 minutes or LESS if I get the dorm I really want.

She then told me that I shouldn't get my Bachelor's and should just go to community college. I told her I JUST did that and had to remind her that she was THERE to see me receive my Associate's Degree earlier this year. Does she want me to get TWO Associate's degrees??? So she changed the subject and said I should work in an office instead of going to college.

I don't know what her problem is. She did the same thing when I was in community college. ""But how are you going to pay for tuition?!"" she asked. When I showed her that it was all covered by Cal Grants, she said ""But college classes are HARD!"" So I showed her my good grades. That kinda shut her up and she NEVER brought up college ever again until now. Sigh. I just want someone to be proud of me for once. I really don't feel like I'm a real person at all.

I almost don't want to go to college because I don't want to be the family disappointment. Can you believe that? I haven't even told my dad that I APPLIED to college, let alome got accepted. I'm about to tell him in a few hours though and will update on his reaction. I really hope his reaction is better than my mom's because I have a major headache and am feeling suicidal from the stress I put on my mom last night. I feel so guilty for reaching my goals and I don't know WHY!

Edit: Thank you everyone for being so kind. I just told my dad—I had a whole speech planned in my head but instead I ended up crying, which made my dad *very* concerned. Once I told him that I was going away to college (after sobbing for like five minutes), all he said was 'Okay. Why are you crying, then?' 

My dad's happy for me, and he said he'll be sad and worried about me but that's in the future. He said to just focus on the present. He also said he knew this was coming, me finally leaving home to do my own thing, and he's proud of me. I'm thankful for my dad, I really am. 

My mom still hasn't texted anything back. I don't live with her, haven't lived with her for a year. In fact, when I moved away to live with my dad last year, my mom said she'll miss me but ""It'll be like you're going away to college! Just remember to visit me."" I do visit her often and I was with her when I got an email from my college saying they were looking at my application (back in October). And she was EXCITED. But now the tables have turned because I actually got into college. Idk what's up with her... ",disintegaytion

797,"Grade unfairly dropped for attendance, what do I do?",750,"Edit: Yes, I have already sent her an email. Did that before I posted this.

It is the end of the term and my professor just dropped my grade 6% for attendance. In the syllabus, it says that 10 points will be docked for any classes missed and 5 points for >10 minutes late. I have never been more than 10 min late and missed one class because I was in a car accident and my car was totaled. The Uber to campus was ~$100 round trip, not something I can afford right now. However, she says there are no excuses (how tf was I supposed to get to class then??). She gave me 50/100 points. I don't even know how that math works out because we only have 7 classes with her (8 week course) and I haven't been late to any. If anything, it would be 90/100 for the day I missed. 

Who do I go to with this? I graduate in a couple days and I'm not letting this one bs class ruin my transcript. This is mostly just a rant but I wish there was someone I could go to for this. 

UPDATE: My professor emailed me late last night (12/16) and said that because I told her ahead of time that I was in an accident (??) that she will not take 10 points off. She also said that because I have proof that I was in class on time, she will not take points off for that either. It's like she was randomly taking points off for tardiness whether she knew if we were tardy or not! My grade is now fixed but I'm still confused. I encouraged my peers to look at tracking on their phone if they have it to see if it shows they were in class on time. ",xo-katie

Most of it was final coding assignments and honestly...that code all sucked because I was so hopped up on pain meds, in my hospital bed, writing code. Most of my professors I think gave me a pity C on my finals since I was a solid A/B student and I had class mates show them photos of me laid up in the hospital bed. One professor did not care though. I had to be there in person to take this final, no exceptions or its a 0.

I had to get wheelchaired up to the building, time my percocets just right so I could have the pain dulled enough to not be screaming but also not hitting me so strong I was incoherent while in class. I will never forget the look on home dudes face when someone wheeled me into his class room, I was very candid that I was incredibly high on prescription opioids and I needed to start ASAP. I passed the final.

804,Professor Won’t Respond to Anything,47,"So I’m on one of the school sports teams and due to the nature of the sport, we spend a lot of time traveling during the semester so I end up missing a lot of classes. Usually I try to stay in touch with the professor and let them know beforehand/during the semester when I’m going to be gone and I try to get all my assignments done before I go out of town. Usually professors appreciate the notice and I’m provided with excusal letters from the school so everything usually works out okay.

Now here is where my current professor comes into play. I’ve tried talking to him in-person and emailing him over the course of the semester, trying to keep him updated with everything that’s going on. When I got in touch with him in-person one time, he verbatim told me “So what? I’m not in [sport]. Anyways, give me a sob story at the end of the semester and maybe we can talk about it then.”

Now it’s the end of the semester, all my other classes are finished. My attendance grade does have a pretty hefty effect on my grade in the class and the man turns into a ghost. For the past couple weeks I’ve tried emails, Canvas messages, office hours (in-person and over Zoom), messaging TAs, even CALLING him with the number provided on the syllabus and no response. Now I’m not trying to be a nuisance and I’ve spaced out my contact attempts for as long as possible as to try not to bother the man, but I just CANNOT get in contact with him!

This is the last thing I need to deal with before I’m out for the semester and it’s frustrating going through this goose chase and jumping through hoops just to try and get a couple minutes to talk with the guy (or even just an emailed response).

I’m at a loss and don’t what to do anymore. The only thing I haven’t done is try and contact his personal phone number because that seems very unprofessional and uncourteous.

I’m not really expecting my any solutions here, just came to rant :P Thanks for reading all, have a great break!

813,Being a TA has lowered my expectations so much,302,"Professor gives review powerpoints and some questions ahead of time so you can prepare. Yet students still ask “what do I need to study” or clearly haven’t prepared a single question by exam time. A lot of the time they don’t even answer the full prompt! “How is X different from Y and speculate why” requires you to list differences AND explain why they might be different. You can’t do one and not the other. If it says write 2 paragraphs, you can’t write 2 sentences and expect many points. 

Then there are basic questions where even if you don’t remember the answer, you can easily logic through it. “Which of these isn’t an example of X” when one answer is something that wasn’t discussed in class or even mentioned at all should immediately be obvious! 

TAs shouldn’t get a dozen questions about when the final is when it’s been posted on the student website and available since the semester started. And we definitely shouldn’t have people asking to make up an exam 2.5 months after it was administered with absolutely no good excuse. It’s not my problem that you decided to wait so long. 

There’s also such a lack of understanding that TAs are students too, usually grad students with a high workload. If you schedule a Zoom meeting with me outside my office hours and then never show up or email me an apology, you’re disrespecting my time.

I am a senior + in college. To summarize, I went to a juco for two years then Covid hit so I took two years of elective classes (like two a semester) online so I could stay home and look after my grandparents. So that’s 4 years in school. Then I transferred to a 4 year uni to get my bachelors. This is my fifth semester here. Since transferring my whole life has gone to shit. I am suffering from severe burnout and I’m just so tired of being a broke college student. I was diagnosed with ptsd two years ago and have been working on the anxiety it causes me, and I’ve been better in most aspects. But I’m sleepless, unfocused, etc. I will sit down to study and stare at a page of notes for HOURS without retaining anything. I got by fine at my juco- but it’s just so much worse here. I have an IEP in math and I’ve retaken chemistry 4 times just to PASS and I still don’t think I will this semester. I feel like the stupidest person on the planet. My two other classes are retakes as well- and I’ve done every homework assignment and taken every test and it’s still not enough. I’ve never gotten such low grades in my life. Then the other class I took my advisor recommended and it was all math, so I tried to drop when I found out it wasn’t a requirement but the advisors don’t email you back here so I missed the deadline. 

I feel SO unequipped to deal with college- at least this college. There are things I never knew about that keep coming up. 

Another factor is my grandparents have payed my way through school till this semester because I turned 24, so I get federal aid. This was another factor of me taking so long, I figured I could take less classes and spend less of their money till I turned 24. Only to find out I have too many “attempted hours” and has to do a whole appeal. It’s just setback after setback it feels like. Now I have to tell them it will be probably another year (HOPEFULLY) before I can graduate and even the thought of going to school again makes me sick. 

Some people will probably see a bunch of excuses but I look at other people and I think that life shouldn’t be this hard, I should be crying everyday and not wanting to get out of bed because of paralyzing anxiety. Any advice is greatly welcomed.

818,When you know your anxiety is stupid…,3,"I just finished and turned in a history essay I’ve been working on for the last month. I still have 36 hours to make any final changes, but I’ve decided that I did the best I could do, and now I’m just chewing my nails over the essay. 

Why am I so anxious about this essay, you ask? Well, it’s the first essay I’ve ever written using Chicago Manual style. As far as I can tell, and as far as the feedback from my professor goes, I cited and formatted everything correctly. I’ve been taking my prof’s feedback on my rough drafts seriously, looked for and edited all grammatical and formatting errors I could find, and saved the shit out of my essay (every time I made a change, I saved it to Word so I could go back in case I wanted to undo something). 

Still, my anxiety is getting to me badly. I know I did my best. I know that everything’s cited correctly. I also know my shit about my topic (it’s an essay about Theodore Roosevelt, who is one of my favorite American historical figures). And it’s only four pages long (not counting all of the endnotes and bibliography, which add another six or seven pages to the overall document). As a writer, I should be proud of this work. And somewhere deep down inside, I am. 

But… goddamn… my anxiety is like, “Fuck you. Your work is trash. And if it’s not trash, you probably fucked up somewhere in the paper and your professor’s gonna catch it and rake you over the coals for it. Where did you fuck up? Oh, you don’t know? Don’t worry, your professor will…”Over and over and over again. 

It sucks because I know it’s just my anxiety talking. I know everyone freaks out over stupid shit towards the end of the semester. I’ve written many academic papers in the past using unfamiliar formatting and citation styles, and so far I haven’t failed any of them (in fact, I’ve done very well).

Second semester, I take 4 classes (12 credits). Technically, I didn't fail any classes, but I got low grades which cause my GPA to dip below 2.0. Inevitable, I was placed on academic warning. I could still take classes and receive financial aid.

After this, I anxiously enrolled in summer classes. I would have to enroll in 2 classes in order to get any financial aid for those classes and so, I hesitantly did. It ended up backfiring, but it was still salvageable.

I still have one last chance; except this time, I would have to pay out of pocket. Luckily, I still have some money from financial aid. I've enrolled and paid for 2 classes. I was withdrawn from 1 of the classes midway through the semester. After this, I thought ""ok, we can still save this! I just need to get an A in the class I'm still in and my GPA would be a 2.0 which mean I'll be off the hook."" And so, I did. I got an A in the class I were still in.

After this I felt happy and relieved. Everything would go back to normal, and I'll have another chance to make everything goes right. I would take 4 classes and receive financial aid for the spring semester. So, I thought! Apparently, I was still placed on academic suspension. I was confused! I have a 2.0 GPA, why the hell did I still get placed on academic suspension? So, I looked deeper. One thing I'm missing is that you must passed %67 of all credits/classes. I pass a total of 8 (24 credits) classes out of all 12 (36 credits) classes that I've attempted so far. That mean I passed 2 out of 3 credits attempted. So, it might've been possible, I didn't pass enough classes. 

My school actually does grade forgiveness by default. What I mean by this is that if you have to retake a class, only the grade from the latest attempt would count toward or against your GPA. Meaning, if you failed a class twice, it would only hurt your GPA once, but it still counts toward your attempted credits vs. earned credits.

I don't know what to do. I tried so hard to get myself out of this mess. I've planned on contacting my advisor and anybody else who could help ASAP. Yes, I made some terrible decision that didn't work out and thing could've gone better if I had acted differently but I was in the heat of the moment and I feel like anybody else in my situation would've done the same. I don't deserve to get kicked out for that. I'm just trying to do what best for me and my future. During the last 2 semester, my grandma got cancer and I were sent to take of her which meant I could only take online classes. We were also planning on moving because of the cost-of-living crisis. I don't want to put the blame on anyone but myself, I'm just stating what happened, so you'll get more of an understanding.",AnonymousUser_42

And second of all, what a great way to encourage me to pursue extracurricular work.

I'm a pharmacy student in my fourth year, and I think I'm starting to lose my mind. For context, in my country, we can't choose our subjects/courses, we're all obliged to study the same thing, and I'll be honest and admit it, I hate it, I find nothing interesting, not because I don't like the stuff we're learning, but because there's just too much stuff to learn.

We have 5 classes and each one has 21 courses per trimester (we have 3 trimesters and 3 exams throughout the year), each one being 45 pages long I'm obliged to remember word by word, which means I have around 100 courses per trimester, and the professors flat out admitted they were gonna do their best to f\*ck us over.

I'm starting to lose my mind, I've studied every single day for the past 3 months, pulling all nighters every week, having no hobby and no social life whatsoever, I only hung out with my friends a couple of times during this period, yet I'm still so far away behind, but when I ask my classmates how they do it, their answer is simple, revise 24/7 from the time they wake up all the way until they go to sleep.

This is making me feel miserable, I feel worthless, like I don't belong, and it's giving me anxiety/panic attacks during which I start shaking, uncontrollably sob and start hitting myself because of the suffocating feeling of guilt I get, and this is happening every single day, I'm losing my mind, I feel dissociated, exhausted and confused all the time, I can't do this anymore.",Prehistoric_Lama

another fun thing about me is that i have a learning disability that impairs my brain from understand math point blank. so when i took chemistry this semester, my brain basically stopped working. i got on medication that helped, but chem was still a very weak point for me. i spoke with my prof many times about my grade, she said with the final exam curve at the end, there's no reason i shouldn't pass the class.

final grades came back, i got a 69. no rounding unless it's within .5 percent of a 70. i don't want to be that person and ""grade grub"" or whatever so it is what it is. i cant walk for graduation and i have to retake it next semester, which would be fine if it wasn't waitlisted until next fall. so basically i'm stuck at community college for god knows how long because i also have to take chem 2. i am just so mad i could scream 😭 i'm going to keep it moving and figure out my options but dear god i am very discouraged",Nervous_Respond_5302

I could have actually learned more and probably actually gotten a job faster this way. The whole reason I didn’t do an internship was because I was never told about it until the last minute, and then I panicked and switched it out for a portfolio class.

Needless to say I’m absolutely LIVID, but what can I actually do about this? I’ll pull out my hair if I have to redo the exam (it’s calculus), but it strikes me completely wrong that they turned in a blank exam to my instructor when they know I was there.

I do have proof via cameras around certain parts of the building, the 3 proctors that watched us, and the person who checked me in for my exam.


Update: My instructor is reaching out on Monday, and I’ll be going in person to discuss this issue with them then as well. I’m hoping they’ll find it or allow my average be put in in lieu of the exam, although I’m not certain what they’ll do since this class is a departmental final.

DOUBLE UPDATE: They fixed it. They scan in the tests and organize them together with the specific version the student needs I suppose, so the wrong one was sent by mistake.

837,College: Expensive and Arbitrary,4,"I recently started back and am working toward finishing a Bachelor's that I've stopped and started three times now. I'm not sure if the problems I'm seeing are to do with me being an older having a different perspective, issues with this particular program, or degrading quality of collegiate institutions at large, but it's a mess. 

I'm getting a degree, primarily, to pursue a career path in counseling. But I'm also interested in learning and improving my writing. I'm offering up thousands of dollars to this institution so I expect some level of quality in instruction. What I've experienced so far, though, (with a few exceptions, admittedly) is inefficient, disorganized taskmasters: teachers relegating obscene workloads in the last few weeks of classes, not offering any feedback on lengthy writing assignments, and grading assignments (literally) 8 weeks late. 

When I was younger, I associated the possession of a degree (especially a postgraduate degree) with a moderate level of intelligence, insight, or even just earnest passion in a particular realm of knowledge. I've come to find that this was totally deluded. I see now that these higher-level degrees signify a willingness to be financially battered and violated by bureaucracy than they do some intellectual virtue. 

Maybe it's just humanities and soft sciences, but it's astounding what a lack of meaningful instruction there is in these courses. Half-assed caricatures of theorists and (bad) YouTube essay tier explanations are the norm, sprinkled with a smelly helping of Twitter politics. Minimum word counts are meant, I suppose, to expedite grading so the university can stick 80 students in a course and save a buck on labor, but ultimately teach students to write and think inefficiently and verbosely. I can't think of any professional sector in which textual fluff would serve a practical purpose. 

But at least if you purchase the 'on-campus' college package, you're able to hear the sub-bass of the latest tracks from Chicago ghettos rattling your dorm walls at night. If you're sociable, you may even get to drink shitty beer at a frat house with future insurance salesmen! You might just get a discounted rate on football tickets, or an STI!

Just so frustrated right now because there were three problems on this exam. First problem went great, no complaints there. Third problem, well I *definitely* wasn't confident on that going into the exam but I needed a 68 for a B so should be able to scribble down some stuff for a decent amount of partial credit and all's well that ends well. The second problem? A damn disaster even though it *really* should not have been. I knew the process, I knew how to plot it. I knew how to find the eigenvalues and all that crap. But my dumbass somehow messed up the fucking steady states. Just a simple ""set a system of equations equal to zero and solve"" and somehow THAT'S the part I messed up. I somehow got confused and forgot that I was supposed to COMPARE THE TWO FUCKING EQUATIONS and just ended up with some complete nonsense. Of course, I only realized my mistake while walking out of the exam hall so nothing I can do about it or anything. I'm just so frustrated and pissed at myself because I studied for hours and hours and just completely blew it all on a goddamn algebra error. They do give partial credit of course, but I'm probably not going to get any because my steady states were wrong, and because of that my eigenvalues were not even in the ballpark and because of THAT my graph was just a complete disaster.

I’m tired of watching Plath professors stumble through algebra mistakes as they write out notes on the board. Or in proof classes writing out full sentences in real time. 

MAKE THE WHOLE PRESENTATION AND THEN PRESENT IT. 

I’ve seen a few teachers actually do this, so I know it’s possible. 

Sure, work through example problems in real time, that’s fine. But having to sit there and watch you write out any definitions, or theorems, or formulas that arnt being proven is simply a waste of time.

I did end up calling her however my wifi was bad on campus so I didn’t have much time to speak with her. I called her about the revisions and she told me to look on canvas to see what corrections she had already pointed out for me to do. I told her that she left no corrections and instead asked me to call her and she said that were far into the  semester and that I should be able to figure out what was wrong with the assignment myself. I mentioned how it would be helpful if she pointed out at least a couple things wrong with my essay because beside MLA issues I don’t understand how I made an F on the assignment, and she’s a really strict and specific grader so I wanted to know if there were particular issues she wanted me to fix. She said that she would leave me a message later on critiquing the paper itself. I told her how I could take it to the writing center to critique whatever errors she wanted me to fix but she insisted I only took it to writing tutoring center to fix MLA formatting issues and that she would send me critiques. 
Anyways , on my final week in the semester, 3 days before the final project is due, I message her asking her a few questions about the other final project papers and also about the revision she would leave me because she never sent them.

__________________________________________

I've had my Graphic Design professor for damn near 3 years, twice a semester, twice a week for 3 hours and it's been a nightmare.

 The way he's treated me felt like I was ""skipped,"" ""excluded,"" and ""ignored."" Critique was always short with me, had very little to say and if it was anything it's ""I don't know how I feel about this one.""

My grades have always been good in his classes but my experience with this professor just made me very depressed and stressed me out till I stopped caring or just started tuning him out when he's talking to other students. 

It infuriates me how nice and caring he his towards other students, making jokes, having side bar conversation that side tracks the class. Then when it comes me it's like ""you had good ideas""

What made me feel even worse was him having a side bar conversation about something I had made saying if felt incomplete instead of saying it to me, or louder so we all could hear. Which makes this embarassing.

Crazy enough, he openly brags about being the chairman head of the art department during class and how ""only what I say goes,"" or  ""you don't want to argue with me, you'll lose.""

Im tired of being treated this way, I've tried asking for advice and apologizing to him for when what he said just really got to me where I got emotional.

Sharing my story to other people it's like everyone sees this behavior but one girl is so far up his side that they became defense and raised their voice at me about it saying ""I still need to talk to him."" Like I did. :/

 It just felt like she didn't understand where I was coming from because of her relationship with him being so good that they constantly make inside jokes during class with the professor in a creepy way. We're all adults they can do whatever, it's just strange to me.

For the life of me i can’t seem to pay attention for more than 2 minutes in class. No matter the grade i receive i feel like it’s NOT good enough.

i have worked my ASS off though. After grades are finalized this semester, I will have 118 credits completed and a 3.956 gpa. (sure some ppl will prob tell me it’s bc of my ‘easy’ major but whatevs) BUT for once … i’m proud of myself. I feel good. I feel hopeful. Kind of excited for next semester. i don’t wanna die for once lol",itspassedmybedtime
850,"4th year, about to fail an entire semester's worth of classes.",312,"I switched to computer science last year and im about halfway through the program, but im in my fourth year total. This is my first time taking a full course load in over a year with all higher level courses and im about to fail them all.

I dont know what's wrong with me. I just dont want to focus anymore. I dont want to do anything. I sit down and study for an hour or two for a day and im out of energy. I can't get out of bed on time. I can't do anything. There are people out there working full time while juggling school, and I still live with my parents like a fucking bum doing 4 silly courses and I can't even do that.

my grades were never great but now im just in the gutter. I honestly just want to quit and starve in the street like I deserve. I am such a waste of time and energy. So much money wasted. I can't even think coherently enough to write out what im feeling at the moment. This is just a half assed rant too. What a joke.",PuddingPleb

852,Mental health causing grades to suffer: a rant,40,"I (21F) am a junior at a university majoring in Political Science. I’ve always been an A/B student, with my semester GPA’s always being above 3.5 except for my first semester of freshman year (3.3 GPA). I’ve also always struggled with mental health. I’ve had my mental health well handled all of college until this semester when I had a bad “friend breakup”, had a close family member suffer from extreme health issues, worked a lot due to lack of financial help from family, and overall, just anxiety and depression getting out of control. 

I dropped one course in October due to how difficult it was and already knew I was struggling mentally and couldn’t handle it. However, I had never dropped a course before and felt like I failed myself. This started causing my extreme anxiety towards school that I never had before, and I almost completely stopped attending my 2 in person classes (other 3 are online). I only went for exams/quizzes, and some other random occasions. The issue with this is that I didn’t communicate this with my professors or TA’s. I currently have an A- in one and a B+ in the other and know I’ll do decent on the finals. However, I know my class participation grade will greatly bring these scores down. 

I’m not really searching for advice, as finals are next week and I know I’ll just have to suffer the consequences of my own actions, just needed to rant as I’m feeling alone in this. 

P.S. I’m starting therapy again next week and ready to start feeling better for next semester. 

TL;DR - I skipped a lot of classes and now feel horrible about it as the semester comes to an end.",Grand-Illustrator904
853,I don't understand why I can't remember,10,"They always tell you that you *""don't need to literally remember everything""* but that is **exactly what it ends up being.** The tests are asking you if you remember what the answer is exactly. When I was in pilot school ( I failed ) I would take practice exams over and over and over again day after day after day because it was easier for me to remember the right numbered choice in the entire fucking question bank than actually know what the 4th type of Hypoxia is or what cloud forms at X feet or what X airspace symbol means. Then I would go in with my instructor and he would ask me some basic information question and I couldn't give him the correct answer that I read over and over and over again hours or the day before. He would grow to think I am a lazy drug addled liar, because I dont **exactly remember.** Do I just not understand what it means to study? am I doing something wrong? Why don't I fucking understand? How do people pass these trials? I feel horribly embarrassed even typing something like this for people to mock me with. 

For instance, the question ""On what step of the RMF does the relevant control system get selected"" I will work through the steps of whatever this is, I will try to review it over and over and over again with my free time after work, I will get the answers right, and then the next day I will read the question again and there is literally no corresponding base idea for me to answer. What's an RMF? It has steps? What are the steps? What order are they in? Totally blank. I don't remember. It's fucking gone. 

In grade school this affected me also and just the same my teachers just thought I was some fuck up and after being degrading, demeaning, or outright cruel, they put me in some assisted learning program full of actually disabled people. Not that I have anything against the people I was with but it ruined my self confidence and put me behind for the rest of my school years.

I am horrified that the same thing is going to happen with this course and I am never going to make over 30 grand a year and my kids are gonna eat processed shit hotdog level food and I'm gonna live in some loud ass dirt suburb or cheap apartment in a crime ridden town after my few remaining elders pass on. Shortly put it is the worst and I fear for it. I don't know what to do.

855,Group Projects :(,21,"Okay, I know this is probably a pretty popular topic, but I just had my first ever group project in college. I expected it to be different from HS but I was completely wrong.

I’ve always been a little more quiet, and gentle mannered, plus I usually get good grades, so teachers tend to think of me as a “good influence”. I don’t want to discredit any of my classmates, and I genuinely do not think that they had any ill intent toward me, but I feel as though I was put into my group to boost THEIR performance?

Anyways, we were given three weeks to complete the assignment, during which, on the second day, they all decided what we were each going to do (I was out that day, but I had set the thing up with each point we had, so they just had to fill it out). They all agreed to their roles, and I was fine with mine, so I did mine in about an hour after class. I wait until the end of the week… and there is nothing in the presentation besides mine, so I ask, and they agree to let me do another. The next week passes, still nothing but my two sections and some pictures that somebody threw in. I remind them of the due date, which was 2 weeks, but one of the weeks was Thanksgiving, so really only a week and a couple days, and they ensure they will have completed their parts by then, so I trust that they will. 

On the day that it’s DUE, I get to class and open the presentation, only to see my two sections, some pictures, and half of one of the other sections done. One of the people in our group, who had not been in class but one time in the past three weeks, starts freaking out but continues to do nothing. So, 45 minutes before it’s due, me and one of my other group mates do everything. I ended up writing 4 out of the 8 slides, she wrote 3/8, and one of the other members wrote 1. AND THEN, when we have to submit it, I ask who would like to do the honors, because I don’t even have my laptop out (this is at 12:43, it’s due at 12:45), and they all just kind of sit there and pack their stuff up?? So I rush to log in ti my computer, and then my school account, quickly pull up the assignment and submit it at 12:44, with probably like 20 seconds to spare. 

And then the next class is presentation. I text them a day beforehand asking how they wanted to go about presenting, two people respond like this, “It’s up to y’all” and “I don’t really care”. 😐. So, yet again, ten minutes before it’s our turn to present, they start texting rapidly in the group chat asking how we’re gonna present; whose going first, whose saying what, etc. etc. Eventually we settle on something and I end up doing the ONE THING I said I didn’t want to do, which was the closing comments. 

Anyways. I was hoping group projects would be better in college, but oh well. I’m taking Eng. Comp. 102 online next semester (because I have to), and there won’t be any group projects so 🫶. Just needed to rant somewhere 😭

856,tired education major,28,"i’m an education major who has always been lightyears better at the humanities than stem. i have a lot of respect for stem majors since they contribute a lot to society and i know i could never do their jobs. being that it’s currently finals week, i see a lot of tired posts relating to majors in their finals. 

i’m so sick of some stem majors dragging down the humanities, especially education and business. your tests are objectively “harder”, but that doesn’t make what i do stupid or easy or irrelevant. i would like to see them do a field experience, or take over my millions of projects, or write all my lesson plans for me. 

teaching is an art and not everyone is fit to do it. i saw it with professors in my gen eds all the time. just because you’re well versed in a subject does not automatically make you a good teacher. passion does not equal pedagogical skills. 

every major contributes something to society. humanities produce critical thinking skills. the arts add to quality of life. business keeps the economy afloat. stem keeps society developing. and education prepares the future generations to take over. so put your superiority complex away, i don’t want to hear it. 

tl;dr: stem majors are allowed to complain about their major all they want, just don’t put down or drag down other majors and call them easy. we’re ALL struggling in different ways.",DoofEvilInc17
857,"For Non-Athletic Regular People (NARPs), sports culture at D1 universities can get very old, very fast",8,"
To begin, I have no hatred for sports in general. I have siblings who have an immense passion for football, basketball, and tennis. I absolutely go to their games as I want to support their passions and want to see them succeed. I have a reason to be personally invested in their events since I want to see my siblings do well in the hobbies they love.

However, what I don't understand is why sports culture in college is so forced on everything. I go to a Big 12 school, which I didn't choose for the ""college experience,"" but rather my major and the in-state tuition. I'm here for one reason and one reason only: to get a degree, which is why I struggle to comprehend why the whole university has to integrate the sports culture (mostly from the football and men's basketball teams) into literally every aspect of it. The mascot logo is plastered everywhere and so are slogans from the football and basketball games. I get that many students enjoy it and use it as a source of bonding, but I personally have no reason to be invested in the teams. Just because I attend the university doesn't mean that I ""bleed the colors,"" throw up the dumb hand sign in every photo op, or spend my Saturdays drunk and screaming in a stadium or at the TV.

If you like those sorts of things, good for you. But please leave the rest of who have no interest in it alone. Don't make assumptions about my personality based on the university I attend. Please make non-athletic settings neutral and don't inadvertently ostracize those who don't wish to partake in the sports culture.

TLDR: for those who love their college’s sports teams and have tons of school spirit, good for you. But please don’t force it on those who have no interest.

EDIT: yes, it is VERY pushy, especially when they play marching band songs and do dances at commencement events + refer to me as a <insert mascot name here> in publications and announcements, assuming that I must like it (I don’t in the slightest). ",KopyKatH20
858,People keep giving me blank/dirty look in college,240,"I (20F) keep getting blank/dirty looks from people. I’m currently in my third year of college and I’ve always noticed that I catch people’s attention but people have been staring and looking at me a LOT since the semester started.

I’ve noticed people looking at me before because I know I stand out. I am a black student going to a PWI, I’m on the taller side, and I have really big curly hair. But for some reasons the staring has been more intense this school year and I don’t know why.

I’ll literally just be walking by myself minding my own business and people will break their neck to look at me. Like fully turn around and look at me. It’s never even just a quick glance either, they’ll look directly at me until I look at them. Even if they were in a conversation they’ll turn and look at me until I catch them and then they just continue talking like they didn’t just do that. It’s usually a blank faced look or an annoyed/dirty look. 

What also confuses me is that it’s mostly other girls who stare. Some guys but majority girls.

Just a little while ago I was waiting behind a girl to get something to eat and she fully turned around, stared into my soul while looking kinda irritated, and then turned back around. Kind of like a “why are you behind me” look even though everyone else was waiting for their turn, it was crowded, and she was taking a bit too long.

At first I thought I was overthinking things. I thought that maybe my anxiety was making me feel like people were looking at me when they weren’t so I tried just looking at my phone or looking straight ahead but I ALWAYS ended up catching someone looking at me and they would always look away when I caught them. It’s been happening every single day now and it’s gotten to the point where I feel more anxious to go to school events or even to the dining hall.

It honestly makes me feel very isolated. I’m eight hours away from home and have no friends or family here. It doesn’t bother me that I’m alone but all the staring is started to make me feel like something’s wrong with me. I’m just trying to do my work and get through the year but the staring has been a huge blow to my self esteem and mental health. I’ve been finding it hard to find motivation for school work because of my situation.

TL,DR: People I go to college with keep staring and giving me dirty looks when I’m just minding my own business.

However, my college had ZERO career events this semester. There was one ""career meeting event"" I attended which was a complete waste of time. It was basically just a seminar explaining how to sign up for the campus career opportunity portal, which is just a broken website that has had the same 4 or 5 jobs posted for literally over 3 months with no updates, no new entries, no new anything over the course of the entire semester. 

I skimmed through the campus calendar and was a little shocked that there were no career fairs scheduled or anything. However, there were a few ""where can I work with this major"" workshops and resume building activities. I figured I'd attend those, except lo and behold: EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM ENDED UP GETTING CANCELLED. Wtf?

861,"My 3 hour long class consists entirely of either time wasting, or popcorn reading.",11,"My instructor is a new teacher, so I completely understand the struggle.

There is literally 0 reinforcement or genuine lecturing, and it is incredibly frustrating. I respect him a lot as a person, but as a teacher… good lord. 

It often seems like he hasn’t read the text books either, as we will often have to explain concepts to him when we read it. This class is fairly challenging too since I am attending aviation maintenance school and have almost no background in anything mechanical, so I’m basically on my own in this class.

I have been frantically emailing the TA in charge of the research because the syllabus says don’t email the course professor or TA (even though I did after panicking more).

I'll just give two examples:1: My roommate's mom was in the hospital on her death bed two states away when midterms were happening. They emailed their prof. about taking it on a later date due to the circumstances and they basically said ""nope. Take it or fail.""2: Roommate's laptop charger crapped out the other morning when they went to fire it up to take their final before work and they had no time for me to let them on my rig, get set up, and get it done before work.

I told my advisor and she got it all situated and I spent 5 years here taking all these classes. 

Now I’m graduating this month but I found out awhile after I applied for graduation that I’m only getting 1 degree with both majors listed instead because there were 3 classes I needed to take and I didn’t so I don’t qualify for two degrees. I did ask her about those classes as I was taking everything except them but she assured me I didn’t need them and no point wasting money/time on them. 

She no longer works at my school and apparently I’m not the only one who she has done this too; she switched to a different campus. My new advisor said that the only way to get both degrees is to not graduate this month and stay 1 more year to finish them.

And then they just signed the paper, not even giving me an explanation on why they did not do the work. We got an A on that paper.

How can I politely tell him he needs to eat with his god damn mouth closed? I'm minutes away from screaming in his ear. It's gotten so bad I've bought earplugs and would rather deal with my tinnitus than his eating noises.

I understand you can never eat silently but jesus fuck I already have to deal with 0 privacy and having to cave to him sleeping til 2 all while he doesn't care about what I'm doing.",JollyScarfVGC
881,Not figuring out life is giving me anxiety intensely,11,"


I can't believe 2023 is about to end in few weeks, yet the whole year went by and I haven't fixed or figured out one thing in life. I didn't take classes in college because of confusion path and that made me stuck so I thought about exploring and researching other career paths that can be a good option but I haven't figured out nothing. I now feel once again mentally pressured like what the hell am I doing. I do not want to repeat 2024 like the rest of failure years. Im dealing with extreme social anxiety yet this overthinking, doubts and negativity is making me lead to downfall path in life. My confidence is gone down. My willingness to learn, fight, sacrifice has faded away. I'm in community college and now I'm just considering why don't I just get a 2 year degree hopefully that could open some doors to newer opportunities and spark interest in other areas of life. I only have few weeks to decide and to do as classes once again start next month. It's a new year, new beginning,new classes and new path maybe I don't know. I'm currently working on completing radiology tech program like pre reqs. But the only concern that's eating me up is getting accepted in the program which I just do not know as the program is competitive and few students get accepted. Im trying to reconsider other options but just don't know. Should I keep going or change paths. Sighs 🤦",Akashh23_pop

The worst just happened. I've been monitoring daily on the course catalog how many people have enrolled in her course (i.e., how many teammates I'll be having) and noticed today that she closed the course and now I'm the only student in this class....I'm shitting myself lmao

Every other Independent study course taught by other faculty has a max of at least 3 seats available, and one course even has 9 students onboard...I got stuck by myself under a strict chair of psy. I'm not the best at statistics and really wanted to collaborate with others to work through this but I feel like I'm biting off way more than I can chew at the moment *by myself*.

884,Professor is clueless when it comes to emails,9,"Got a professor for one of my major classes and she could not be more clueless when it comes to emails. She takes forever to respond to emails and half the time she doesn’t respond if she doesn’t like the content of it.

I’ve always been taught that you have an email with basic etiquette like

“Dear Prof: 

Sorry to bother you…, thank you for your time and consideration, please let me know as soon as you can…, 

Sincerely,” 
 
You’re supposed to do that even with the professors that just respond with “k.” The thing is, those professors always had the decency to respond in a way that answered what I needed even if it wasn’t presented in a formal way. 

Whenever I needed to schedule an exam cuz I need accommodations for a health issue, she genuinely did not know the process. She’s new at the university. I had to come to class and explain to her that she needs to provide confirmation to the office and she kept saying “what confirmation do I need to provide? Why do I need to confirm? Just set up the appointment and take the test with them!” 


I had a discussion over email with the office about how I asked her about it and said she didn’t know that she was supposed to provide confirmation. I forwarded her the thread so she could see what I was talking about. She did not respond.


When I asked her the next class why she didn’t respond to my email, she said that it was too much and that she couldn’t keep up with everything. There was 4 messages in that thread combined between me and the office, none of which exceeded more than a paragraph. 


What the hell is wrong with her? You’re supposed to schedule the exam at least a week before with the office and her confusion made this process so long that I couldn’t take it until a week later. I had to reschedule it the day of because I was feeling very sick which was the same day as class so I couldn’t see her for days and you’re not allowed to reschedule until they get confirmation that you’re permitted to take it on that day. 


She took so long to respond to the reschedule email that I ended up waiting another week before I could take it. 



Now with another exam, I had a similar problem where I had to reschedule it cuz I had symptoms of my health issue that day and she would not respond for 9 days until she responded “you gotta get confirmation from the office.” 


What confirmation?! 


What the hell is she talking about? She only responded after they closed for the weekend so now I don’t even know if they’ll let me take it cuz I recall them not allowing you to take non-final exams during finals week which starts in the middle of next week. I honestly don’t know what to do. I hope it all works out. 




TLDR: Prof doesn’t respond to emails half the time and when she does, it’s usually unhelpful or just tells me to meet her after class when the entire thing we discuss could’ve been 2 lines on an email.",spoiderdude

892,Finding out I might not get into my major,19,"Graduated years ago with a 2.3 GPA (all my fault-was just not focused, constantly procrastinated, didn’t study hard was just happy to pass at the time). Stuck in a dead ended job; need a career change-going back for another degree 

This time I’ve learned from my mistakes and I study almost every day-no more cramming.It’s going well, I’ll most likely end up with A-minuses in most my classes. Just finishing up my prerequisites and my application for my major is due in January 

College website says the minimum GPA for the major I’m interested in is 2.0 and I am above that, so I thought I was clear. But met with my intended department advisor and he informed me it’s competitive and they usually don’t admit people under 2.8-pretty much I can still apply but they only accept like 20 people a year if more than that apply someone with a stronger pre-requisite gpa will take priority over me; sounds fair but sucks for me :(

Even if I got all A’s this semester I wouldn’t be able to boost my GPA to that much. And I don’t have time to retake my classes I got C’s and below in…I would have to wait at least another year

894,Groupmate used ChatGPT to write part of our essay... about AI,38,"I'm honestly not even mad, this is just very funny to me. 

In my class we have a 25 page report due at the end of the term. Early on in the semester, like in late September, we decided to make our topic about AI, and have been working on it since.

One of our members has been consistently behind and seemingly lost. He was late to submit work for our first two drafts, the work he does submit is terrible, almost never shows up to class or our group meetings, and struggles to get through presentations. 

Honestly it wasn't a huge deal since we had a pretty big group and we could more than handle the workload. But with the deadline coming up, we went over the work we had, and we immediately noticed our one groupmate's work looked weird. It was in a completely different style than his usual writing. 

Part of my section for this essay was to actually test out some different AI detection tools. So while we were in-class I quickly plugged his writing into the tools I used just to see what would happen. Now granted, these tools are unreliable. But that said, his work came back as being nearly 100% AI generated for every tool we used, significantly higher than almost every human-written essay we tested (most didn't go above 30-40%). 

And I mean... it just LOOKS like an AI essay. I also generated some fake essays to test for my section of the work, and it's in basically the same format you'd get from asking ChatGPT ""Write me an essay about [topic]"".

I have no earthly idea what he was thinking. We've been working on this topic for over a month, we literally wrote about how people use AI for plagiarism... did he think we wouldn't notice his obviously AI generated work?? It's honestly funny to me.",wt_anonymous
895,I can't sleep because of my roommate,40,"Bg info: my roommate's alarm initially would wake her up at 4am because she preferred to study early (our first class is at 9) but it was very loud and made it hard for me to go back to sleep (she is an iphone user) and we talked about it and agreed that we will use my phone instead and put my phone on her side of the room because with my android the volume can be adjusted.

Now, she said that just to make sure she gets up she will also set her own alarm at a later time (e.g 4.15am) incase mine doesn't work. This was the agreement.

What happens is, my alarm wakes her up, but she snoozes it and it rings again and again, along with her backup alarms as well. The series of alarms makes it impossible for me to go back to sleep, and I've tried to talk to her about it and she says she will wake up immediately,  but never kept her word. This morning, at the third alarm I alerted her that it was the third alarm and that I can't sleep. She snapped at me and said ""It obviously wasn't intentional""

I was very shocked by the tone but I didn't say anything and now she isn't talking to me.

This isn't the only thing that prevents me from sleeping, she also always has her notifications on and the beeping and vibrating makes it hard for me to fall asleep, she likes to play the quran loudly because it helps her sleep (she's religious) but it is difficult for me, and sometimes she makes a phonecall or records a voice message. We live in a university apartment, not just a room, where she can go into the living room to do all this but she prefers to stay in bed

The class is now over, but I feel so awful, a fraud that simply can't stop falling upwards.

I hate party pooper classmates. I'm a in class that is graded exclusively with exams and is not curved. It's a really easy class. like maybe 10hr of studying will get you an A in an exam. Not other work needed.

Throughout the semester there has been extra credit point opportunities that pop up during class as a way of basically rewarding attendance. One of the students messaged the dean that these extra credit points aren't fair because it's not on the syllabus. The professor then removed all extra credit points from the final grade calculation.

I'm so mad. Having those points literally harmed no one because there a strict no-curve policy and it benefitted the majority of students that actually cared to go to class. ugh.",Express_Technology37
899,Annoyed at my professor/myself,4," I know it’s my fault for not realizing something obvious, but I’m still annoyed. In my class we’re graded on 8 projects, and after each project there’s a group discussion. I’m shy so I naturally hate discussions, I’m always getting cut off or the professor moves on to the next topic before I can say anything. I overall participated in the discussions but in 2 I didn’t get a chance to say anything.

Fast forward to today, I have an A- on one project and A’s in the other 7. I’m thinking I have an A in the class. Right before our final class ends, the professor casually says that if we didn’t participate fully in all discussions, we get a grade deduction. For example an overall A would go to an A-.

I’ve been trying to get my gpa up because in my university if you have a gpa of 3.5 or higher you get to register for classes early. In my major, the waitlists are insane. By the second day of enrollment, most upper level courses are waitlisted/closed (for example, class capacity of 15, waitlist 25). I really wanted to avoid this, I’m so sick of getting the unluckiest enrollment appointments and not getting the classes I need (already had to delay my graduation because of this + advisor fuck ups).

901,I feel like some elements of college are a complete lie,35,"I was originally going to post this on the r/college thread but this thread is more applicable. For reference I graduate college about two years ago and still struggle with the concept of college. I really enjoyed my experience in college but I feel like some aspects of college are simply not true. Maybe it is because my younger brother is now in college and I see the truth that I was naïve to when I was first moving in. Who knows? Regardless here are a few things I feel like are a lie about college. 

1. The concept of ""going away"". I am not sure who started this phrase but I hear it quite often. I really do not know how your going away when it comes to college. Of course there are some students who really do go away. Some students come other countries some come really far away states. However, I feel like at most schools the vast majority of students are 1 hour to 2 hours away. Maybe it was just me but I quite often remember students going home every other weekend. 
2. ""This is the next step into adulthood""- I feel this statement is far from the truth. College did absolutely nothing to prepare me for adulthood. Keep in mind this coming from the perspective of someone who grew up in a semi-privileged middle class household. Regardless, college did not prepare me to get a credit card, college did not prepare me to get a job. If anything I feel like most majors will not get you a job unless you somehow get lucky. College did not tell me you need to make a certain amount of income to rent an apartment. 
3. ""You go to college to get a job""- This is the last one I promise since this is already long enough. I honestly find this statement far from the truth. I get colleges want to make money, so they will show off their career centers and show some inflated stat on how 98% of graduates get a job. Yet, I can say for most people not the case. Unless you major in something with hard skills or something that will get you a certification finding a job will not be easy. I am not saying everyone is doomed but take it from a guy who studied politics as a school with not a great politics program. Out of my 9 classmates in the same major everyone went to law school or was just able to find entry level legislative jobs that paid horribly and had little room for growth. 

I recognize this rant is long and college is not designed to simply get you a job or prepare you for adulthood. However, these were messages I received when looking at schools and as a young naïve 18yr old I truly believed them. Hence the rant lol. ",Papa_Louie_677
902,I can’t stand my college environment!,9,"I’m a current sophomore right now and while I like some aspects of my college I hate the location and environment for so many reasons!

1. The location: I’m in a small town in the cornfields of Illinois. There is so little stuff to do outside of school. The most exciting thing to do is loiter at abandoned factories or hang out at a nearby pond. Not too mention, that there is no good food. It’s mostly fast food chains, and a few Asian and Mexican joints. I’m from the big city where there’s a bunch of different foods and culture and things to do and there’s none of that here

2. The college size: The enrollment is about 1000 or so people. It’s all the same people over and over again. I feel like that is crippling my social growth. Not to mention the dating pool is horrible. So few women to talk to romantically when you factor in the number of women who are taken, queer, and just plain not interested. It’s also terrible to meet people who share my interests. I have quite a lot of niche interests and at a school with not even 2000 people I can rarely ever meet people who share common ground.

3. Race demographics: I go to a majority white school. And I’m black. There are probably less than 150 Black people in the entire school, which sucks for me. I want Black friends and people who relate that way but it’s so hard. It’s even harder to find Black people who share my interests as well, which makes it hell!

I’m just tired of my college environment, I really want somewhere more vibrant and urban but that’s a pipe dream for me. Every urban school that I want to go to costs a fortune and my grades are too poor for the possibility of transferring. I can’t believe I have to deal with my situation for another 2 years!!",

904,My classmates don't care and it's kind of bumming me out,119,"In one of my classes this semester, there are technically 15 students enrolled. 9 of them quit coming to class after the first few weeks. They're still enrolled in the class (and therefore on the hook for the full tuition since it's so late in the semester), they just don't show up or do any work. The remaining 6 are so apathetic about the whole thing that I honestly don't understand why *they're* still showing up. It's not just that they don't care about learning the material, or that they don't want to be there; they don't even seem to care what grade they get. There have been several low-stakes extra credit assignments that were supposed to give people an opportunity to bring up their grade (I'm talking stuff like ""make a basic model of something we've covered using these kiddie art supplies I'll provide for you, and I'll give you a 100 for one quiz grade""), and they didn't even do those. 

I know that none of this affects me, and I should continue to make my best effort the same way I always do. But I can't help but be demoralized that the rest of the class has been doing nothing but complaining about the fact that they're in this class, and will probably *still* get at least a C because it's a community college and the administration cares more about ""student retention"" than about whether anybody learns anything. It's also just really awkward when the professor gets frustrated and starts scolding everyone else for their lack of effort, but can't say ""not you u/halflifeconsequences, you're cool,"" so I still feel like I'm getting yelled at even though I know it's not directed at me.

905,How can I make new friends,6,"

Hello, my first time posting here, and I’m having issues with friendships at the moment. I hang out with a group of friends, and I enjoy their company, but, they drink a lot.. and I drink with them at parties, and we get drunk or tipsy, but some like to drink on weekdays, and I don’t mind drinking.. but I don’t need it to have fun. One of the girls today in the group confessed to me and another girl in the group that she’s sad when she’s sober, but said it a joking way, and said she’s only happy when she’s been drunk with us, and that she gets depressed when she’s sober.. and that was just a red flag to me. Some, but not all smoke a bit, and today we went to a movie, and some of them were talking in a group chat about getting high, and some already drinking a bit. Look I’m not offended by people drinking or smoking. I drink socially, and I’ve never smoked, but i just felt like “why can’t we just go and enjoy a movie normally?” I also feel like I’m not really connected with them in a way. I hang out with them.. but it feels like some of them are closer to each other than to me. I’ve asked to hang out with some of them before one on one, but one of the girls can’t stay with plans. She initiated we should order pizza together one day, but when I asked her one week if she would be available she said yes.. but ghosted me, and I confronted her about it, not mad or anything but just why she didn’t respond, and she just said she was “busy” and that we can do it next week if I wanted. But there’s never a set date to do it, and I don’t want to be chasing after someone or seem desperate. She just seems to hang out with 2 other girls in the group she’s closest to, and they hang out most of them time, and one of them is the girl I mentioned earlier in my post about not being happy sober. So idk I’m just feeling down about this. I’m enjoying college but this is upsetting me. I joined a snowboarding club and met cool people in there, but how can I get these people to hang out outside of snowboarding? It just feels impossible at a commuter school when I live on campus, and some live off campus. Any advice guys? I’m thinking of joining another club next semester to meet even more people.",vromero2021

907,Commuting is killing my already non-existent study regiment,7,"I'm a non-traditional environmental engineering technology student Commuting six hours a week to school and it's beginning to sucks. Watching my grades slip/knowing I'm doing the bare minimum to keep up with assignments and such is brutal on my mind. This past year I was at a local satellite campus and did pretty damn good- got 3.7 GPA. The only class I had issues with was Geology. I barely studied but got a B. I should have taken that as a hint to get my shit together....

I'm hoping next semester goes a bit smoother, but I'm also very concerned I may not pass my Cell Biology Lecture class this semester (a first year science class). Ive got the ""easiest"" of the Bio teachers, and lots of folks are complaining about the difficulty of the applied questions this professor asks on quizzes and assignments. It's not enough to memorize a definition or functions to answer a question, you have to fully understand 2+ definitions and how they interact with each other to answer 1 question. Which is good- but not how most student are used to being taught/asked questions. Prof. frequently says this to us too. 

I just got a 67% on my midterm- which I DID study for, we were allowed a full 8x11"" paper with notes, and which was supposed to have ""less applied knowledge"" questions on it. I have no friends on campus to study with. I can ask my SO to help me study, hopefully that would help. As for most of my other classes, I'm passing with okay or good grades but don't feel very confident about anything. Especially my math classes- but thats another ball of wax.

Any thoughts or advice? I can stay late after class/on campus 1 day of the week only. On Day 2 of class, I'm on campus from 8am-7pm doing classes. Day 3, I go for 1 class and have to come back home to go to work. ",Toomanyacorns
908,"It feels like this semester was a waste of money, mental health, and time",15,"Finals are in 2 weeks and I realized that engineering is not something I want to be doing. I originally was going for bioengineering, as I thought it would be the best for me. 

However, as I am an engineering major, that also means I must take statics/mechanics of engineering. A class that I found out not only is not required in other bioengineering programs across the country, but a class I despise with a passion. To explain why I despise it, it’s because the page has way too much stuff. A lot of the questions are like a type of building component, and you have to set up equations and solve for said components. And there’s so many numbers and angles that my brain doesn’t know what to do anymore. The pictures are always confusing. It’s difficult to solve a problem when you don’t know wtf you’re looking at

In addition, I realized neuroscience would be better for my career goals. I always wanted to go for something related to the human brain, and I chose bioengineering because I saw how much of a growing field it is in psychiatry. 

But because of this, I’m not probably going to fail the course. And it sucks because it’s gonna be an F, meaning I’ll have to retake the course at some point and my GPA will drop. 

This semester overall has been a shit show

Calc 3 (I have done alright in this class)

Cellular biology 1(haven’t done as well, but nobody I know has done well in this class either. Another dumb thing was I already have bio credits but I was required to take this class because of engineering. Now if I need a grade boost, I need to take a class I already have credits for due to the gpa goals I require)

Differential Equations (I withdrew from this class, I personally thought it was the most useless thing I’d ever had to do and the bioengineering advisor…agreed with me :/)

Statics/mechanics of engineering (you already read my rant, the advisor also agreed that it was a useless class since I was cellular bioengineering rather than biomechanics)

Physics 2 (slow start to the semester but I picked it up and feel better about my chances now)

But these grades aren’t at the level I know they can be. And it’s because holy shit is it a lot of work. Start of the semester I’m trying to study for 5 extremely difficult courses. Because of this when I withdrew from 1 of them, I was behind on the other 4. I manage to catch up for calc, but not for engineering, bio, and physics. 

It just feels like way too much for a normal human to handle and I don’t know what to do about the fact this semester feels like a waste of money.",MooseHeavy3675

so basically my professor is an extremely rude, snarky, ignorant and overly sarcastic asshole who loves to pick on and humiliate his students. he claims its his method of  ""active recall"" but its pure bullshit. all he does is pick a random student to torment that day and ask them every five mins if they understand in a passive aggressive manner. from the very beginning of this semester he decided to pick on me and use me as an example for the rest of the class unprovoked and and constantly demand for me to pay attention even though im literally in the front row and staring directly at him. one thing ill never forget him telling me is that I should never disclose my disability to my employers because its ""bad for business""....... his way of ""teaching"" is basically reading out slides, overcomplicating basic concepts, and giving out snarky responses to anyone who dares to ask him a simple question.  today was honestly everyone final straw. after basically everyone flopped on the exam we had last week, he was heated about it and started blaming all of us for it. he went up to peoples faces and forced everyone to redo each question till we get it right. he told some other student who was dead silent the whole time to shut their mouth when another student said the answer (which was correct) he even hunted down a student who left the classroom and reprimanded him for it. what is this high school? thank God I don't have to deal with his ass again.",blueburrey

My will to want to be at this school has completely shifted. I have grown out of this environment, and now I am seeking change. As a sophomore, moving into this dorm felt so different. It didn’t feel right. Something felt so wrong. Maybe it was myself telling myself this isnt good for me anymore, that this is not like it used to be. Maybe it was growing pains, no longer being a freshman, living in a single room, sharing a wall with my previous roommate. I don’t even know where it all went wrong. Now I’m likely transferring, glad to leave behind the bad but sad to leave the good in hopes for more peace and happiness. I am just inching for the semester to end and the day I move out will be emotional. But I think it’s what’s best for me. I had my freshman year of fun, bliss, and some hardships, and it’s no longer like that. Which is fine, but I’ve grown out of even wanting to have this college life. I know finals are coming up, but I’ve felt like this for more than half the semester.

915,I can't stand this,25,"I feel like time is passing me by. Throughout my entire life college was anyways hyped up as one of, if not the best time of one's life. That expectation makes it all the more crushing to be so alone. Just day in, day out, class>work>go home>study/homework>repeat. No hanging out with friends, rarely seeing family, no dating. Nothing to look forward to besides some video games/TV shows. 

Seeing other people on campus with friends or partners or whatever, hanging out, making memories, while I've got nothing.

People say that time flies when you're having fun, which I think is true to an extent. But I've also noticed that, in my experience, time flies when you're not making memories. In high school, a semester felt like a semester because there were many memorable things that happened there. Whereas, this semester for example, I don't really have any memories. Yea, I've done stuff, but you don't remember the day you went to class, work, and studied. You remember hanging out with friends, going out and doing stuff, stuff like that. But there is none of that for me. It feels like this semester started 3 weeks ago, not 3 months.

I feel like an outsider on my campus. At best, people tolerate me. No one likes having me around and certainly I'm not missed when I'm absent. I tried joining clubs but all those attempts failed.

And based on what I see people saying, it's not gonna get much better. For every comment I've seen/heard saying that socialising is easier post college, there's a dozen saying it's not. It feels like the last time in my life that I'm supposed to have lots of friends and do fun things is slipping through my fingers day by day as I waste away.

I enjoy my major but being liked by others is my #1 desire in life. And being so absolutely alone has killed any motivation I once had for any class. And any motivation for life in general honestly. My grades have plummeted, I've gained 30 lbs this semester, I stopped working, and I'm really depressed in general. I just feel like I'm decaying.

920,When a professor can't solve a textbook problem...,15,"Hello,

So I was just reminiscing on an incident that happened a few semesters ago when I took Linear Algebra. 

Our professor was very aloof, generally disinterested, and seemed lazy. She had no real lesson plan, and just copied textbook problems and solved them without much interaction from the class. 

This professor also has terrible ratings on RMP.

Anyways, there was a particular problem that I was solving in a different textbook on Linear Algebra (same subject matter, different textbook). 

This problem was a simple, introductory Linear algebra problem on vector spaces. 

I presented her with this problem during her office hours, and after looking at it for like 5 minutes, she straight up told me she doesn't know how to solve it.

Later, I found the answer myself on Chegg. It was relatively easy because the steps were explained.

I'm sorry, but seriously? How can a professor straight up not be able to solve an introductory Linear algebra course? This same professor also teaches discrete math, and many higher level abstract math classes that are waaay more complicated than introductory Linear algebra.

Am I being too tough on my professor/having unrealistic expectations? College isn't free, and I do expect my professors to know their subject matter.",

I asked how much less and they just told me I won’t be able to afford the rest of the semester so now I’m stuck in orgo and I only have 3 more weeks left. I need to have 2 letters of recommendation, but none of my professors look at their emails. I only have one professor that would do it for me, but they are taking forever and won’t check their emails. I feel very stressed and alone. My guidance also doesn’t help me at all she keeps telling me if I don’t do (insert thing here) I will be behind, but aren’t they supposed to help find a different path and not constantly tell you that you will be behind? 

Who can I ask for a letter of recommendation when I’ve never had a job before and when none of my professors will answer me? I am also only able to apply once a year so if I miss the due date this time, I would have to apply another year. 

Note: I put (insert thing here) because she says that for everything I ask her. She would be like if you drop out of this class you will be behind. 

I just wish my guidance would reassure me and be like dropping out of this class would be good for your mental health and you can still take it another year.

we literally used to be the best of friends at the beginning of the semester… we both got placed in the same dorm room because we both suffer from mental issues and chronic illnesses. she was so nice and communicative the first few weeks and we were both so glad we had each other as roomates. she was well organized, clean (still is) and we both talked about our backgrounds. things were good until a certain conflict going on in the world right now ( i don’t want this post to be removed) happened and her family members are in combat right now. obviously she’s very upset about this and i gave her some space during this time but over time her behavior is just slowly becoming unbearable. 


it’s been a month since the initial incident happened and she’s been either coming back extremely upset, verge of tears, or angry as hell. she’s constantly angry at those who are against her side and also either gives me a complete silent treatment for a week or go on long rants about what’s going on. eventually she had a mental breakdown where i had to slowly get her to bed as she looked like she was losing consciousness. now, whenever i have a friend over she comes back to the room, curses under her breath, and slams doors until we both awkwardly leave. a week prior to this after hearing that her and her family are going through a tough time i decided to go back home for thanksgiving just to give her some space. the second i come back she starts acting like this. i cannot for the life of me stand slamming doors as someone who has come from an abusive household. she refuses to talk about anything now. this is getting ridiculous as fuck now it’s kind starting to piss me off.",blueburrey
925,I am not passing my classes,22," 

I'm kind of in panic mode and not sure what I should do. My semester, before school even started, was pretty rocky. I broke up with my S/O of almost 3 years, who I lived with, and was essentially homeless two weeks before class, had no money to get textbooks or prep for classes. I worked full time throughout the semester, and started taking extra shifts and doordashing to pay bills at my new apartment and get basic essentials.

In the last semester alone, I was couch surfing for the first few weeks, I almost died from hypoxia, I was diagnosed with bipolar after the worst manic episode of my life, was rediagnosed with anorexia, moved twice, went through a shooting in my building, lost my car, ended up about $3,000 in debt. I'm working nearly 60 hours a week because that's the most I could do while in school, actually far above what would be comfortable but it's what I have to do. This was all on top of 15 credit hours at school.

I'm generally a good student, besides the occasional burn out. I haven't failed any classes yet, and I'm a sophomore. I'm terrified of failing, but I'm not on financial aid so I'll have to pay for my next semester, so there's sort of a silver lining. Prior to losing my car, I was working on school every day consistently. I'm not a lazy student. I just don't really know what's going to happen from here. I want to keep going and do better next semester, I just don't know if I'll be suspended or kicked out or anything.

Then I had to focus on another class that was ending earlier, come back to this and it’s just… assignments galore. 

My professor follows rules to the T. She takes points off for missing more than three classes, points off for walking into class ten minutes late or more and will question you in front of the rest of the class why you’re missing assignments. 

With the work I’ve got piled up, I didn’t want to deal with that. So I haven’t been attending class in a couple weeks so I could just focus on getting the assignments done. Now that my work load has gone down significantly, I figured I would go back to class this Tuesday, but now I’m super nervous about it.

Maybe I am stupid, but I don’t want anyone else acknowledging it. Especially my professor.

If I could, I just wouldn’t go to that class at all anymore, but I don’t want to keep missing points on it. I just wish college wasn’t so damn stressful.

I enter majoring in global studies and switch it to something more broad, social and behavioral science, while I chose an area of study, but I thought of switching to environmental science, but it seems that every time I'm interested in a field, that only last for a bit and then I'm no longer interested, there's nothing I'm passionate about enough that I want to make it my career, idk, the longer I take to settle on major, the long I'll be here. I just don't know. I've taken dozens of test, quizzes and nothing interest me. I honestly just wanna drop out, but I don't really have any other plans. I'm not gifted at anything in particular nor smart, I do pretty average in my classes and don't even know where I would want to transfer. At this point I'm only going to college for the sake of going. I feel so guilty.",sunnyisthemoon
